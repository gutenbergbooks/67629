  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'>This Dictionary was commenced as an amended edition of that written
by M. Ernest Bosc, architect of Paris, and contains the 450 engravings published
in the French work, to which about 250 more have been added. Little
or nothing, however, of the text of M. Bosc’s work has been left standing; his
definitions having, in the process of revision under reference to original works,
almost entirely disappeared. The whole work, as it now stands, has been
drawn from, or carefully corrected by, the best authorities in each of its special
branches. Considerable prominence has been given to <span class='sc'>Architecture</span>, from
the French original corrected from English writers; to <span class='sc'>Christian Antiquities</span>
from <cite>Martigny</cite>, and the Dictionary of <cite>Dr. Smith and Professor
Cheetham</cite>, and other authorities; to <span class='sc'>Mediæval Armour</span>, and terms of
<span class='sc'>Chivalry</span>, chiefly from <cite>Meyrick’s Ancient Armour</cite>; to <span class='sc'>Costume</span> from <cite>Planché</cite>
and <cite>Fairholt</cite>; to <span class='sc'>Heraldry</span> from <cite>Boutell’s</cite> and <cite>Mrs. Bury Palliser’s</cite> works;
to <span class='sc'>Pottery</span>, the substance of the articles on this subject being derived from
<cite>M. Jacquemart’s</cite> work; to <span class='sc'>Needlework</span>, <span class='sc'>Ivories</span>, <span class='sc'>Musical Instruments</span>,
<span class='sc'>Goldsmiths’ Work</span>, <span class='sc'>Painters’ Materials and Processes Ancient and
Modern</span>, <span class='sc'>Colour</span>, &amp;c., with references to the several authorities referred to.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <span class='sc'>Greek and Roman Antiquities</span>, which are the principal part of M.
Bosc’s work, have been in this volume reduced to the smallest possible compass:
the Dictionaries of Dr. Smith and Rich must be referred to by those who
require fuller definitions upon this subject, which would of itself fill ten such
books as the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few <span class='sc'>Indian</span>, <span class='sc'>Chinese</span>, and <span class='sc'>Japanese Terms</span>, which have come into
ordinary use in art, have been sought out and inserted: in the first-mentioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span><cite>Dr. Birdwood’s Handbooks</cite> have been a most useful guide. Finally, it is
necessary to state, that many words essential to the completeness of the work
would have been in danger of omission, if I had not had before me <cite>Mr.
Fairholt’s</cite> admirable <cite>Dictionary of Art Terms</cite>, which, occupying a more restricted
ground than this, is so thorough and accurate in dealing with all that it professes
to include, that the only <em>raison d’être</em> of this work is the very much wider and
different ground that it covers, and the greater condensation of its definitions.
Obviously the substance of every statement in the work is borrowed from some
previous writer on the subject, and it is evident that a Dictionary of Reference
is not a convenient vehicle for theory or invention.</p>

<p class='c007'>The appended list of <span class='sc'>Classified Catalogues</span> which have been prepared
by direction of the authorities of the South Kensington Museum, will have the
additional use of referring the reader to the fountain-head at which he can
verify and amplify the condensed information that this work supplies.</p>

<p>Fig. 1. Abaculi used as pavement.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abaculus</span></strong>, Gr. and R. (a diminutive of <em>abacus</em>,
q.v.). A small square or cube of glass, or some
vitreous composition made to imitate stone or
glass of various colours. <em>Abaculi</em> were employed
for the inlaid-work of pavements, or the incrustations
of mosaic.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Abacus</strong></span>, Gr. and R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄβαξ</span>, a slab or board).
1. In general a rectangular slab of stone, marble,
or terra-cotta. 2. A board or tray used in arithmetical
calculations, and constructed for reckoning
by tens. 3. A play-board divided into
compartments, a kind of backgammon in use in
antiquity. The same term was also applied to
a board used for another game of skill, the <em>ludus
latrunculorum</em>, which was more like our chess.
4. A side-board on which were displayed, in the
<em>triclinium</em>, or dining-room, silver plate and other
table utensils. 5. A slab of marble, used for a
coating in the decoration of a room or apartment
of any kind. 6. A square slab of terra-cotta or
wood, placed by the earliest builders at the top
of wooden columns, in order to give them a
broader head, and so afford a better support to
the beams which rested on them. It was this
motive that gave rise to the formation of the
<em>abacus of the capital of a column</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Abaton</strong> or <strong>Abatos</strong>, Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">α, βᾰτὸς</span>, inaccessible).
A term used generally to denote any inaccessible
place, such as the <em>cella</em> of a temple, an adytum
from which the profane were excluded. The
term <em>Abaton</em> denoted more particularly a building
in the city of Rhodes, which contained,
together with two statues in bronze, a trophy
commemorating a victory gained over the
Rhodians. This memorial had been placed in
the building by queen Artemisia, who had consecrated
it to a divinity. To destroy it would
have been a sacrilege, and as no one could be
allowed to penetrate into the interior of the
<em>Abaton</em>, without the defeat of the Rhodians
becoming known, all access to it was forbidden.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Ablutions</strong>, Chr. There were various ablutions:
that of the head (<em>capitilavium</em>), as a
preparation for unction in baptism; that of the
hands (<em>aquamanile</em>), during Mass, &amp;c.; that of
the feet (<em>pedilavium</em>), including the ceremony

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Abolla</strong></span>, Gr. and R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀναβολὴ</span>, a throwing back
and around). A cloak made of a piece of cloth
folded double and fastened round the throat by a
brooch. <em>Abolla major</em> was the name given to
the ample blanket in which the Greek philosophers
were accustomed to wrap themselves.
This cloak was adopted by the philosophers as
an instance of their humility, because it was
mostly worn by the poorer classes at Rome. Fig. <a href='#fig_003'>3</a>
is a representation of one of the lictors, with
his fasces on his shoulder, and wearing the <em>abolla</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Abraxas</strong>, Gr. (a mystical or cabalistic word
formed of the Greek letters <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">α, β, ρ, α, ξ, α, ς</span>).
Cut stones or gems of very various shapes, upon
which are engraved the words Abraxas, Abrasax.
They are also known as <em>Basilidian</em> stones or
gems, because they constituted the symbols of
the gnostic sect of the Basilidians. Certain
peoples looked upon them as magic amulets
against particular maladies and demoniacal
influences. The impressions on these stones are
very varied; cabalistic figures, the signs <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Α</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ω</span>,
and the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΙΑΩ</span>, which designates the Supreme
Being. Numerous explanations have been
sought for this term <em>abraxas</em>; some philologists
assert that it comes from the Persian [or Pehlvi],
and that it signifies <em>Mithra</em>; others derive it from
the Hebrew, or the Coptic, while others again
recognize in it only a numerical sign, the letters
of which, added together, would give the number
365, or the number of days that make up the
year, and in this case <em>abraxas</em> would symbolize
the annual revolution of the sun. A figure
often found upon Abraxas stones is that of a
serpent with a radiated lion’s head (Chnouphis),
which rears itself amid seven stars. The reverse
of these stones often bears the inscription <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΤΩ
ΧΝΟΥΦΙ</span>, “To Chnouphis.”</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Absidiole.</strong> Diminutive of <em>apse</em>, and thus used
to denote a small apse terminating a lateral nave,
while the apse closes the central or chief nave.
(See <span class='sc'>Absis</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Absis</strong> or <strong>Apse</strong></span>, R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁψὶς</span>, a bow or vault). Any
enclosure of semicircular form terminating a
room, hall, &amp;c. There was an <em>absis</em> in the
<em>Basilica</em> (q.v.), or court of justice, and it was in
the semicircular recess thus formed that the
judges’ seats were placed. Many temples also
had an <em>absis</em> attached to them, and there is one
in particular of this description well known to all
archæologists. This is the <em>absis</em> of the temple
of Venus at Rome, which was built by the
emperor architect Hadrian. (See <span class='sc'>Apse</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Abutment</strong>, Arch. called also <strong>Impost</strong>. The
solid part of a pier from which an arch immediately
springs.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Abydos, Tablets of</strong>, Egyp. Under this term
are designated two hieroglyphic inscriptions containing
the names of Egyptian kings. These
tablets were graven upon the walls of a <em>cella</em> in
a small temple at Abydos, in Upper Egypt;
hence their name. The first tablet, the beginning
of which was destroyed at the time of its
discovery, contains the names of the kings of the
twelfth and eighteenth dynasties; this inscription
was discovered in 1817 or 1818 by J. W. Bankes,
and drawn by Caillund in 1832; it had been
taken down from the wall of the temple by
Mimaut, the French consul at Alexandria. It is
now at the British Museum. The second tablet,
which begins with Menes, who is generally supposed
to have been one of the first kings of Egypt,
contains a complete list of the two first dynasties,
as well as a great number of names belonging to
kings of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, ninth,
tenth, and eleventh dynasties. This tablet was
discovered in 1864 by M. Mariette. It is reproduced
in De Rougé’s treatise on the six first
dynasties.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Abyssus</strong>, Egyp. A Coptic word, read by
some archæologists as <span class='sc'>Noun</span> (q.v.), and which
signifies the <em>abyss</em>, the immensity of the celestial
waters upon which sails the solar bark.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Acacia</strong></span>, R. A term employed by some antiquaries
to denote an object held in the hand of
the statue of an emperor of the Lower Empire.
It usually consists of a piece of cloth, which
the emperor unfurled as a signal for the games to
commence.</p>

<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄνθος</span>, a flower). A plant, the ornamental
foliage of which has been largely employed as
an architectural decoration by different peoples.
The acanthus has been applied to the ornamentation
of friezes, cornices, modillions, and
various other members
of architecture,
but in especial to
the decoration of modillions
(projecting
brackets) (Fig. <a href='#fig_004'>4</a>) and
of Corinthian and
composite capitals.
There are several
varieties of the acanthus;
those most in
use are the cultivated
acanthus, or Brankursine
(<em>Acanthus mollis</em>), and the spring acanthus
(<em>Acanthus spinosa</em>), the foliage of which is
much less beautiful, and furnished with small
spikes which make the plant resemble a thistle.
This last has also often been applied to decoration,
in the Romano-Byzantine and lanceolated
styles of architecture. An English name for
this ornament is the “bear’s claw.”</p>

smoke). Wood for fuel, which had undergone
several operations to hinder it from smoking
when put on the fire. One of the methods
employed consisted in stripping the bough of the
bark, immersing it in water for some days, and
then leaving it to dry. In a second method,
the surface was rubbed with oil or oil-lees, or
else the piece of wood was plunged into the oil
for a few moments. A third method consisted
in slightly charring the surface of the wood by
passing it through the flame. The wood prepared
by this last process was also called <em>cocta</em>
and <em>coctilia</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Acatium</strong></span>, Gr. and R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκάτιον</span>, dimin. of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκατος</span>,
a light boat). A description of vessel belonging
to the class called <em>actuariæ</em>, i. e. were propelled
either by sails or oars. The <em>acatium</em> was a fast-sailer
much employed by the Greek pirates.
The stern was of a rounded concave form (<em>inflexa</em>),
and the prow was adorned with a beak
(<em>rostrum</em>). (See also <span class='sc'>Actuariæ</span>.) The name
<em>acatium</em> was also given to a drinking-vessel
which was in the form of a boat. The Roman
<em>scapha</em> was a similar vessel.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Acca.</strong> A word used in the 14th century for

<p class='c007'><strong>Accidental</strong> or <strong>complementary colour</strong>, the
prismatic complement of a ray of light: such are
<em>orange</em> to <em>blue</em>, <em>green</em> to <em>red</em>, and <em>purple</em> to <em>yellow</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Accidental light.</strong> An effect of light in a
picture independent of the principal light, such
as that on the Holy Child in the <em>Notte</em> of Correggio,
or that of a candle, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Acclamations</strong>, Chr. Formulas employed by
the first Christians to express their grief on the
occurrence of some misfortune, or on the other
hand, to testify their joy at some piece of good
fortune. These acclamations were imitated from
the nations of antiquity [e. g. at <em>marriages</em>, “Io

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Accubitum</strong></span>, R. (<em>ad</em> and <em>cubitum</em>, an elbow).
A bed or rather couch of a peculiar kind, upon
which the Romans reclined at meals, and which
replaced the <em>lectus triclinarius</em>. It was a kind
of sofa holding only a single person, while the
<em>lectus triclinarius</em> held two or three. The act of
reclining on this sofa was called <em>accubitio</em> or
<em>accubitus</em>, a term derived from <em>accubo</em>, to recline
at table.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Acerra</strong> or <strong>Acerna</strong></span>, R. (prob. from <em>acer</em>, maple).
A small square box with a hinged lid; a coffer
used to hold the incense for sacrifices; whence
its Latin names <em>arca turalis</em>, <em>arcula turalis</em>, <em>acerra
turis custos</em>. The <em>acerra</em> appears on certain bas-reliefs
among the sacred utensils. It is to be
seen represented on the altar of the small temple
of Quirinus, at Pompeii, underneath a garland,
and above an augur’s wand. It is generally met
with, as being carried by the officiating priests,
at religious ceremonies. The attendant carried
the <em>acerra</em> in the left hand and employed the
right hand to sprinkle the incense on the flame
of the altar; whence the expression <em>libare acerra</em>.
The term <em>acerra</em> was also used to denote a small
portable altar placed before the dead, on
which incense was burnt during the time the
corpse was exposed to view (<em>collocatio</em>). The
altar was also named, from this circumstance,
<em>ara turicrema</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Acetabula</strong></span>, R. A kind of bronze cymbals,
attached to the hands and feet, as also to the

cymbals which were played by striking them
with a stick of hard wood.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Acetabulum</strong></span>, R. (from <em>acetum</em>, vinegar). A
cup for vinegar used by the Romans at meals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <em>acetabulum</em> was also a goblet used by
jugglers among the Greeks and Romans to make
nutmegs disappear. By the latter these jugglers
were called <em>præstigiatores</em>, by the former <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψηφοκλέπται</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψηφοπαίκται</span>. Lastly, we find in
Pliny the Elder that <em>acetabulum</em> was the name
given to a dry measure of capacity, equal to the
quarter of a <em>hemina</em> or the half of the <em>quartarius</em>,
and equivalent to .1238 of a pint. [The Greek
<em>Oxybaphon</em>.]</p>

The effect of an arrangement of lenses by which
a coloured ray of light is rendered colourless.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Acicula</strong>, Gr. (dimin. of <em>acus</em>, a needle or
pin). In particular a bodkin used by the Roman
ladies to keep the hair in its place when curled
or plaited, and to keep on false hair. The words
<em>acicula</em> and <em>acus</em> are however all but synonymous.
The former does not denote a bodkin of smaller
size than the <em>acus</em>, but an object made of an
inferior material; the <em>acus</em> being of silver, ivory
or gold, while the <em>acicula</em> was simply of bone or
some hard wood such as box, myrtle, olive, &amp;c.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Acinaces</strong>, Orient. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκινάκης</span>; orig. a Persian
word). A straight poniard resembling a very
short Roman sword, used by the Eastern
nations of antiquity, especially, the Medes,
Persians and Scythians. It was worn by
soldiers suspended from a belt round the waist,
but the weapon hung either at the right or the
left side, according to the nationality and
accoutrements of the soldier. When, however,
he wore a sword, this was always placed at the
left, and the <em>acinaces</em> at the right side of the
body. The handles of these weapons are generally
extremely rich.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Acisculus</strong></span>, R. (Diminutive of <em>ascia</em>, an adze
= a small adze). A small pick employed by
stone-cutters and masons in early times. Representations
of it may be seen pretty frequently
on medals, in especial those of the Valerian
family. [See <span class='sc'>Ascia</span>.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><strong>Acketon</strong></span>, Fr. A quilted leathern jacket, worn
under the armour, introduced from the East by
the Crusaders.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Aclis</strong> or <strong>Aclyx</strong></span>, R. A sort of harpoon, consisting
of a thick short stock set with spikes.
This massive weapon was chiefly employed by
foreign nations, but not by the Romans. It was
launched against the enemy, and drawn back by
means of a cord to which it was attached, to be
launched a second time. This weapon bears
some resemblance to a particular kind of <em>angon</em>
(or trident). (See <span class='sc'>Angones</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Acoustic Vases</strong></span>, R. (Gr. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκουστικὸς</span>, pertaining
to the sense of hearing). Vases of earthenware
or more often of bronze, which, in the theatres
of antiquity, served the purpose of strengthening
the voices of the actors. Vases of this kind
would also seem to have been employed for the
same purpose during the middle ages, for the
architect Oberlin, when repairing the vault of
the choir, in the ancient church of the Dominicans
at Strasburg, discovered some acoustic vases
there.</p>

holding unmixed wine). A table vessel for
holding pure wine, while the crater (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρατὴρ</span>), on
the other hand, contained wine mixed with
water. These vessels were often dedicated to
Bacchus. They were made in earthenware and
metal, but those that were dedicated to the gods
were of gold and silver, and had their place
among the treasures of the temples. Fig. <a href='#fig_007'>7</a> represents
a silver acratophorum found at Hildesheim.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Acrolith</strong>, Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκρον</span>, end, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λίθος</span> stone).
A statue covered with garments which in many
cases were gilded. The extremities of these
statues were of marble or stone—whence their
name—more rarely of gold and ivory. The
Minerva of Areia, at Platæa in Bœotia, described
by Pausanius, was an <em>acrolith</em>. This
was by Pheidias. The <em>acrolith</em> period is the
infancy of the Greek plastic art.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Acropodium</strong>, Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκρον</span>, end or point; and

basement to a statue and often forming part of it.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Acropolis</strong>, Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκρό-πολις</span>, upper or higher
city). From its primary meaning the term came
to signify a fortified city. They were very
numerous, in ancient times, in Italy, Greece
and the colonies of Asia Minor. Most ancient
Greek cities were built upon hills, and the citadel
on the summit of the hill was called the <em>acropolis</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Acrostic</strong>, Chr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκρον</span>, end, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στίχος</span>, a row
or line). A combination of letters formed out of
some word, which is thus made to express a
thought differing from its own meaning. For
instance, the Greek word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ΙΧΘΥΣ</span> (ICHTHUS,
fish), symbolizes, in the primitive church, the
name of Christ. The following is the acrostic
of this word: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ιησους, Χριστος, Θεου, Υἱος, Σωτηρ</span>

extremity of beak of a ship). An ornament
employed by the ancients to decorate the upper
extremity of the prows of ships. This ornament
often figured among trophies, since it was the
custom for the victor in a naval combat to take
the <em>acrostolia</em> from the captured ships. It is
frequently to be met with on the bas-reliefs of
triumphal monuments. Fig. <a href='#fig_008'>8</a> shows an <em>acrostolium</em>
taken from a bas-relief in the Museum of
the Capitol. The object seen projecting from
the acrostolium is a sounding lead.</p>

extremity of anything). In a signification more
restricted than the primary one, yet generally admitted,
the term <em>acroteria</em> is applied to the plain
socles and pedestals placed at the summit of
buildings to support statues, groups, or other
crownings. <span class='sc'>Acroterium</span> was the common name

needle, or pin. The <em>acus</em> denoted both a needle
for sewing and a pin for fastening anything.
When used for the hair it was called <em>acus
crinalis</em> or <em>comatoria</em>. In Christian archæology
the word applies to the jewelled pins used as
fastenings to papal or archiepiscopal vestments.
The Roman <em>acus</em> is worn in the hair by the

of Pompeii possessed an <em>adytum</em>, and it was here
that was discovered the Portici Diana now in
the Naples Museum. There was also an <em>adytum</em>
in the temple of Delphi, which was burnt down
in the first year of the 58th Olym., and rebuilt
by the Corinthian Spintharus. The temple of
Paphos contained in its <em>adytum</em> a representation
of the goddess under the form of a column
pointed at the top and surrounded by candelabra.
The engraving shows the position of the adytum
of a small Doric temple, now destroyed, which
once stood near the theatre of Marcellus at
Rome. The <em>adytum</em> was the name given to the
<em>cella</em> of a temple, in which oracles were given,
or the worship was connected with mysteries.

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Ædicula</strong></span>, R. (dimin. of <em>Ædes</em>, q.v.). A small
house, temple, chapel, tabernacle, or even shrine.
Thus the name was given to a small wooden
shrine, constructed to imitate the front of a
temple, and in which were preserved the
ancestors of the family (<em>imagines majorum</em>),
together with the Lares and tutelar divinities.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Ægicranes</strong>, Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἴγειος</span>, of a goat; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρανίον</span>,
the skull). A goat’s [or ram’s] head employed
as a decoration by ancient sculptors. It was
used chiefly to adorn altars which were dedicated
to rural divinities.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Æginetan marbles.</strong> Two remarkable groups
of very early (archaic) Greek sculpture, in the
Glyptothek at Munich—discovered in the temple
of Pallas-Athene at Ægina, and arranged by
Thorwaldsen. They illustrate “the infancy of
art, which lingers round symbolic representation,
and has not yet grasped the full meaning and
truth of nature.” (<cite>Butler’s Imitative Art.</cite>) The
anatomy of the bodies and limbs at this period
is greatly superior to the expression of the heads.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Ægis</strong>, Gr. In its primary meaning, a <em>goat-skin</em>.
The primitive inhabitants of Greece used
the skins of goats and other animals for clothing,
and defence. At a later period the <em>Ægis</em> became
a protective mantle; the shield of Minerva, beneath
which the goddess sheltered those whom
she wished to protect from the enemy’s missiles.
Later still the <em>Ægis</em> denoted the breastplate of a
divinity, in especial that of Jupiter or Minerva,
as opposed to the <em>lorica</em>, which was the breastplate
of a mere mortal. The ægis bore in its
centre the Gorgon’s head, of which the serpents
were arranged round the border. Minerva
is generally represented wearing it, either as a
cuirass or a scarf passed over the right shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Aëneator</strong> (Lat. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aëneus</span></i>, brazen). The name
given to any musician who played on an instrument
of brass (<em>aëneum</em>); such as the <em>buccinatores</em>,
<em>cornicines</em>, <em>liticines</em>, <em>tubicines</em>, &amp;c. They
formed a college.</p>

Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἴολος</span>, the
wind; and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πύλη</span>, an
orifice). A metal vase
with a narrow orifice,
which was filled with
water and placed upon
the fire, either to make
the chimney draw
better, or, according to
Vitruvius, to show
which way the wind
blew.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Æolian Harp</strong>, Gr.
A musical instrument
that is played on by the
wind passing over its

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Ærarium</strong></span>, R. (<em>æs</em>,
money). The public
treasury as distinguished
 from the private
treasury of the Emperors (<em>fiscus</em>). Under the Republic
the temple of Saturn served as the public
treasury, and here were preserved the produce
of the revenue, the public accounts and other
public records. The army had a separate
treasury of its own called <em>ærarium militare</em>,
entirely distinct from the <em>ærarium publicum</em>. It
was established by Augustus to provide for the
special expenditure of the army.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Aerial perspective.</strong> The realization of the

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Æro</strong></span>, R. A basket made of rushes or broom,
but still more commonly of osier, and used for
conveying sand. It was employed by the Roman
soldiery when at work on intrenchments, excavations,
or fortifications, as may be seen from
bas-reliefs; more particularly some of those
which adorn the column of Trajan.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Æruca</strong></span>, R. (<em>æs</em>, bronze). A very brilliant
green colour artificially made to imitate <em>verdigris</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Ærugo</strong></span>, R. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verdigris</span></i>, the same colour as
<em>æruca</em> (q.v.), but obtained from oxide of bronze.
It is difficult to establish a real distinction between
the two terms, as Pliny gives the name
of <em>ærugo</em> (the rust of bronze) to what Vitruvius
calls <em>æruca</em>. It is probable, however, that <em>æruca</em>
was a kind of verdigris obtained by artificial
means, while <em>ærugo</em> was the natural verdigris.
This has given rise to the two terms, which by
many archæologists are confused together.
<em>Æruca</em>, the artificial copper rust, formed by
the action of wine refuse upon copper, is an
acetate of copper (verdigris): while the genuine
copper rust, <em>Ærugo</em>, is a carbonate of copper.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Ærumna</strong></span>, R. A kind of fork by which

metals. It also serves, in various connexions, to
denote a number of different objects. Such as
<em>æs candidum</em>, a brass mixed with silver; <em>æs
Corinthum</em>, a brass mixed with gold; <em>æs Cyprium</em>,
the ancient name for copper. (See also

<p class='c007'><strong>Aetos</strong>, Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀετός</span>). A Greek word signifying
<em>eagle</em>, and by analogy, a gable, pediment, or
higher part of a building generally, so called
from the resemblance which these parts bear to
an eagle with outstretched wings. In the same
way the Greeks gave the name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πτερὰ</span> (wings),
to the outer rows of columns flanking each side
of a temple.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><strong>Affidati</strong></span>, It. One of the Italian literary academies.

to glorify). Any work of art dedicated to a god,
whether it were placed in his temple or not;
such as tripods; [braziers for incense], or other accessories
of a temple. The low pillar placed over
a tomb, or the statue of a god might be <em>agalmata</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Agate.</strong> A variety of quartz often employed
by the engravers of antiquity. The term is a
corruption of the word <em>Achates</em>, a river of Sicily,
on the banks of which numerous varieties of the
stone abound. Among these maybe mentioned
the <em>cerachates</em>, or white wax-like agate; <em>dendrachates</em>,
or arborescent agate; <em>hemachates</em>, or
blood-agate, so called from its blood-like spots;
and <em>leucachates</em>, or white agate. Agates were
often carved into scarabæi by the Egyptians,
and Babylonian cylinders have been found, made
of the same material. The oriental agate is
semi-transparent, the occidental is opaque, of
various tints, often <em>veined</em> with quartz and
jasper; hence its fitness for cutting cameos.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Agathodæmon, Cup of</strong>, Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀγαθο-δαίμων</span>).
A name given by the Greeks to a cup consecrated
to Bacchus, and meaning literally, the
“Cup of the Good Genius.” It was sent round

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Agea</strong></span>, R. A narrow passage or gangway in
a boat, by means of which the boatswain (<em>hortator</em>)
communicated with the rowers.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Agger</strong></span>, R. A general term to denote a
mound of any materials, such as that formed
by a dyke, quay, roadway, or earthwork;
and particularly a rampart composed of trunks
of trees and employed in offensive or defensive
warfare. A celebrated <em>agger</em> was that of
Servius Tullius at Rome. The art of constructing
<em>aggeres</em> and other fortifications, had
been learnt by the Romans from the Greeks,
who in their turn had derived it from the East.
It was after having penetrated into the heart of
Asia under Alexander the Great, that the Greeks
learned the use of siege works employed in
the attack or defence of strong places, and
became acquainted with various kinds of warlike
engines such as the <span class='sc'>Acrobaticon</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Agnus Bell</strong>, Chr. A sacring bell.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Agnus Dei</strong>, Chr. <span class='sc'>The Lamb of God</span>, or lamb

used to denote certain ornaments or medallions of
wax impressed with a figure of the lamb. They
represented the ancient custom of distributing to
worshippers, on the first Sunday after Easter, particles
of wax from the consecrated paschal taper.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Agolum, R.</strong> A long sharp-pointed shepherd’s
stick used by the Roman herdsmen for driving
their cattle. The <em>agolum</em> was made out of a
straight shoot of the prickly pear; it is still in use
among the herdsmen of the Roman campagna
at the present day.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Agonalia</strong> or <strong>Agonia</strong></span>, R. A Roman festival,
which derived its name from the word <em>agone</em>
(shall I proceed?) the question asked of the
<em>rex sacrificulus</em> by the attendant, before he
sacrificed the victim. The Quirinal was called
<em>Mons agonus</em>, from a festival being held there on
the 17th or 18th of March, in honour of Mars.
The day itself was called <em>Agonium martiale</em> or
day of the Liberalia. Another explanation of
the etymology of the name is that the sacrifice
was offered on the Quirinal hill, which was originally
called <em>Agonus</em>. (Consult Ovid. Fasti, i.
319–332, he suggests several explanations.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Agonistic</strong>, (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγωνιστικὴ</span>, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν</span>, a contest).

to fasten armour, when
they were made of leather

onyx (<em>onice</em>), &amp;c. The Egyptians used alabaster
for making statues, phials, panegyric vases,
canopea, small figures, and even sarcophagi;
of which last that of Seti I., now in the British
Museum, is an example. Alabaster was at one
time frequently used for tombs and carved figures,
and is now used for pulpits and other ecclesiastical
purposes. False alabaster is the name
given to a gypseous variety of this substance,
of which there are rich quarries at Volterra, in

<p class='c007'><strong>Alum</strong> is used in many processes—in the
preparation of paper for water-colour painting,
and of <em>lakes</em>, and <em>carmine</em>, from cochineal. <em>Roche
alum</em>, or roach alum, <em>Roman alum</em>, and <em>Turkey
alum</em>, are varieties of the common alum, described
by mediæval writers as <em>alumens</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alumen</span></strong> (Lat.), Greek, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">stypteria</span></i>). Mediæval
writers confused this word with the alums.
The name was applied by the classics to several

<p class='c007'><strong>Amatito</strong>, Ital. Lapis Amatita. Amatito is
the <em>soft</em> red hæmatite, and is called also <em>matita
rossa</em>. <em>Lapis amatita</em> is the <em>compact</em> red hæmatite,
and is also called in Italy <em>mineral cinnabar</em>, and
in Spain <em>albin</em>. When this word is used by early
writers on art, it probably indicates <em>red ochre</em>,
the red hæmatite of mineralogists. (Fairholt.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Amber.</strong> There are two varieties of this
substance, viz., the grey and the yellow amber,
of which the latter only need here be more
particularly noticed. Its use may be traced
back to a very early antiquity, the purposes to
which it was applied being the setting of jewels
and furniture. It was employed by the Jews
for making amulets. Amber was also used by
the Egyptians in the fabrication of necklaces
composed of pearls or other delicate materials.
By the Romans it was sculptured into vases or
statuettes. The name of <em>vasa electrina</em> was
given to amber vases set with silver, and that of
<em>electrina patera</em> to pateræ made of amber alone.
Amber was largely used by early painters as a
<em>varnish</em>, and also as a <em>vehicle</em>. It is harder than
copal, and is said to be the most durable of all
varnishes. It requires a long time to fit it for
<em>polishing</em>. Amber is supposed to be a vegetable
fossil; it is washed up by the sea, especially on
the shores of the Baltic.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Amber Yellow</strong>, is an <em>ochre</em> of a rich amber
colour in its raw state; when burned it yields a

<p class='c007'><strong>Ambitus</strong>, Gr. R. and Chr. (<em>ambio</em>, to go
round about). A small niche in underground
Greek or Roman tombs forming a receptacle for
a cinerary urn. In the Middle Ages these
niches were so far enlarged as to admit coffins;
the name under which they then went being
<span class='sc'>Enfeus</span> (q.v.). During the same period the
term <em>ambitus</em> was also applied to the consecrated
ground by which a church was surrounded. It
served as a place of asylum as well as for burial.
The term is also applied to the process of canvassing
for votes.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Amenti</strong> or <strong>Amenthi</strong>, Egyp. One of the names
given to the nether world of the Egyptians. It
means the <em>unseen region</em>. We learn from
Plutarch’s treatise on Osiris that, “the subterranean
regions whither souls betake themselves
after death is called <em>Amenthes</em>.” Osiris is the
lord and god of Amenti, which was also called
by the Egyptians the <em>country of truth</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Amentum</strong></span>, R. A thong attached to the shaft
of a lance at the centre of gravity. The soldier
placed the fingers of his right hand between the
two ends of the thong, gave the weapon a rapid
turn, and then hurled it. <em>Amentum</em> was also
used to denote the leather strap by which certain
kinds of boots, such as the <em>crepidæ</em>, <em>solæ</em>, &amp;c., were
fastened above the instep.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Amess.</strong> (See <span class='sc'>Almuce</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Amethyst</strong>, (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμέθυστος</span>, without intoxication.)
A precious stone of a more or less deep
violet colour. The engravers of antiquity
carved figures upon it, in especial those of
Bacchus, since the stone was also used, in preference
to any other, for making drinking-cups,
from a belief that it possessed the virtue of dispelling
intoxication. This was the origin of the
Greek term. Among the ancient Jews the
amethyst was one of the twelve stones composing
the breastplate of the high priest; it occupied
the eighth or ninth row. In Christian symbolism
the amethyst (or the colour violet) signifies
humility and modesty.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Amiantus</strong>, (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμίαντος</span> [? undefiled]). A fibrous

<p class='c007'><strong>Amice.</strong> A piece of fine linen in the form of
an oblong square, suspended over the shoulders
of the clergy. <em>Pugin</em> says it is “a white linen
napkin or veil worn by all the clergy above the
four minor orders.” <em>Durand</em> says it is a proper
covering for the head, typical of the helmet of
salvation alluded to by the apostle; or of the
cloth with which the Jews covered the Saviour’s
face, when they asked him to prophecy who
struck him. Milton, in <em>Paradise Regained</em>,
alludes to it,—</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Amphora</strong></span>, Gr. and R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφὶ-φορέω</span>). A large
earthenware vessel, having a handle on each side
of its neck (whence the name), and terminating in
a point. Amphoræ were used for holding various
kinds of produce, especially wine; they were
placed side by side in an upright position in the
cellar, the floor of which was covered with a deep
bed of sand. The engravings represent amphoræ
from Cnidus, Chio, and Samos. Amphoræ
were also made of glass; and a specimen is
mentioned by Nepos of one made of onyx.
Homer mentions them of gold and stone; and
the Egyptians had them of brass.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Amphotis</strong></span>, Gr. and R. 1. A brass cap lined
with cloth inside. 2. A simple woollen cap worn
by athletes to protect their temples and ears from
the blows of the <em>cestus</em>, in a boxing match.
3. A wooden vessel in use among the ancient
Greek peasants, as a milking-pail. It derived its
name from having two handles or ears.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Ampulla</strong></span>, Gr. and R. A phial or flask with
short and narrow neck and spherical body,
which was used to hold the oil requisite for
bathers (<em>ampulla oleria</em>); it could also be used
to hold vinegar, wine, and other beverages, and
was then called <em>ampulla potaria</em>. The ampulla
generally took the form of a globe or bladder,
but not invariably; a lentil-shaped variety with
rounded sides was very common. <em>Ampulla
rubida</em> was the name given to the leather-covered
flasks which were made use of by travellers or
sportsmen to carry wine, vinegar, or oil. The
vessel or cruet used in Christian churches for the
consecrated oil or wine was hence called the
<span class='sc'>Ampul</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Ampyx</strong></span>, Gr. and R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄμπυξ</span>, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμπέχω</span>,
to surround). Latin <em>frontale</em>. A general term
to denote any net composed of strings, bands, or
ribbons, which forms a head-band. It thus
denotes at once a woman’s head-dress, or the
ornamental strips of leather which serve as head-band
for a horse. The <em>ampyx</em> worn by women
was in some cases very costly, being made of
gold or silver, and adorned with precious stones.
The term was also applied, by analogy, to the
cover of a vase. Another word for it is <em>ampicter</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Amulets.</strong> Objects of a very heterogeneous
description, to which is superstitiously
attributed the power of healing certain diseases,
or averting them from men and animals. This
is the meaning which attaches, in its widest sense,
to the term amulet (<em>amuletum</em>). Amulets are
unquestionably of Eastern origin; by the Egyptians
they were looked upon as preservatives
against dangers, unlucky days, enemies, &amp;c.
The varieties of them were very numerous;
among others, were scarabæi, small columns,
cartouches, symbolic eyes, interlacing fingers,
heads of uræus, &amp;c. A large number of stones
were also employed as amulets; those of commonest
occurrence are hematite, jasper, lapis
lazuli, amethysts, diamonds, heliotropes, &amp;c.
Each of these amulets had its special virtue;
for instance, the clear crystal worn during prayer
rendered the god propitious, and compelled him
to give ear to the suppliant. Coral kept every
evil influence away from a house; and in Italy
it is looked upon, even at the present day, as a
preservative against the evil eye. In Christian
archæology, the name of amulets, or in some
instances, <span class='sc'>Encolpia</span> (q.v.), was given to relics,
or objects of devotion, such as crosses, medals,
wood from the true cross, the bones of saints,
&amp;c. Amulets were also called <em>periapta</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίαπτα</span>),
i. e. suspended, because they were hung
round the neck, and also <em>pyctacium</em>, because
some amulets were folded in two. The Arabic
word amulet means the same as <em>periapta</em>, that
which is suspended.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Amussis</strong></span>, R. The exact sense of this term is
not clearly defined by ancient authors, beyond
the fact that it denotes generally any kind of
instrument employed by builders—especially
masons—for testing the accuracy, regularity, and
evenness of their work. The term is used to
denote sometimes the plumb-line, rule, or square;
sometimes the level, measuring-line, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Anabathra</strong></span>, Gr. and R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνά-βαθρα</span>, steps
up). Steps or stairs; a raised step; a mounting
block. These last were often placed along the
high roads.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Anabologium</strong>, Chr. Another name for the
Humerale or <span class='sc'>Amice</span> (q.v.).</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Anaceia</strong> or <strong>Anakeia</strong>, Gr. (from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄναξ</span>, a king).
A festival held at Athens in honour of Castor
and Pollux, who were also called <em>Anaktes</em> and
<em>Anakestes</em>. (See <span class='sc'>Anaceium</span>). Similar festivals
were held at Sparta, Argos, and other cities of
Greece.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Anaceium</strong>, Gr. A temple of ancient Athens,
dedicated to Castor and Pollux. Slaves used to

<p class='c007'><strong>Anaclinterium</strong>, Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνακλιντήριον</span>). The
head-board of a sofa or bed, which served as a
support for the bolster and the pillow on which
the sleeper’s head rested.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Anadem</strong>, Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνάδημα</span>). In general a fillet
or head-band; but in a more restricted acceptation,
an ornamental band, such as was worn by
women and youths among the Greeks. It was
thus distinguished from the <em>diadema</em> and the
<em>vitta</em>, which were also head-bands, but worn
solely as the insignia of honorary, regal, or
religious distinctions.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Anaglyph</strong>, (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνὰ</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γλύφειν</span>, to carve).
A general term to denote any work of art that
is sculptured, chased, carved, or embossed, such
as cameos, bas-reliefs, or other raised work,
whether in metal, marble, or ivory. When such
sculptures or chasings are incised or sunk, they
are called <span class='sc'>Intaglios</span> or <span class='sc'>Diaglyphs</span> (q.v.).
According to St. Clement of Alexandria, anaglyphs
were employed by the Egyptians when
they wished to hand down a panegyric of any
king under the form of a religious myth.
Although the words of St. Clement are very
obscure, and have furnished materials for countless
discussions, it is now admitted that the
anaglyphs in question belong to the group of
hieroglyphics which may be deciphered on the
cartouches of the Pharaohs, and in which we
have, in fact, panegyrics of the Egyptian kings
veiled in religious myths. The Egyptians also
gave the name of anaglyphs to a kind of secret
writing, understood only by the initiated; even
at the present day it remains undecipherable,
owing to our imperfect knowledge of Egyptian
mythology. (See <span class='sc'>Cælatura</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Anagogia.</strong> A festival at Eryx, in Sicily, in
honour of Aphrodite.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Analemma</strong></span>, Gr. and R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνάλημμα</span>). Any

buttress. (2) The pedestal of a sun-dial, and
so the sun-dial itself.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Anancœum</strong></span>, R. A drinking-cup of great

<p class='c007'><strong>Anankaion</strong>, Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀναγκαῖον</span>, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνάγκη</span>,
restraint). A kind of prison the purpose of
which is not exactly known. According to
some archæologists it was a private prison for
slaves, or for freedmen, who, from some fault,
were reduced to servitude again; others assert
that it was a public prison.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Anapiesma</strong></span>, Gr. and R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνα-πίεσμα</span>, that
which is pressed back). An appliance used in
ancient theatres. It was a kind of trap-door by
means of which deities were raised from beneath
the stage so as to make them visible to the
spectators. The <em>proscenium</em> contained a certain
number of these trap-doors; one of them, leading
from the orchestra to the front of the stage,
enabled the Furies to appear; by another,
marine deities made their appearance; while
that through which passed the shades who ascended
Charon’s staircase was called <em>Charon’s
anapiesma</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Anastatic.</strong> An ingenious modern process of

<p class='c007'><strong>Anchor.</strong> In Christian Art, the emblem of
Hope. The attribute of S. Clement, the Pope,
who was bound to an anchor, and thrown into
the sea. (See <span class='sc'>Ancora</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Ancile</strong></span>, R. A shield of the shape of a violin
case. It was the sacred shield which, according
to tradition, had fallen from heaven into the
palace of Numa. It occurs frequently on medals,
especially those of Augustus. The two incavations
of the shield were more or less deep, and
usually semicircular. But Ovid describes it as
of an entirely different shape, being cut evenly
all round; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Idque ancile vocat, quod ab omni parte
recisum est</span></i> (Ovid, Fast. iii. 377). The <span class='sc'>Salii</span>,
or twelve priests of Mars Gradivus, had twelve
such shields. The form was oval, with the two
sides curving evenly inwards, so as to make it
broader at the ends than in the middle. They
used to beat their shields and dance.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Anclabris</strong></span>, Gr. and R. A small table used
instead of an altar at sacrifices; it was slightly
concave, so as to adapt it to hold the entrails

masons, which form an angle similar to that
formed by the bent arm.</p>

a bend). An anchor or piece of iron used to
stop a ship. Like those now in use, the ancient
anchors were generally furnished with two
flukes or arms, but sometimes they had only
one. In the latter case they were called <em>terostomos</em>,
a term corresponding
to our
modern blind
anchor. A bas-relief
on the
column of Trajan
represents an
anchor placed at
the bow of the
vessel. In Christian
archæology
the anchor is a
symbol of hope;
an anchor is frequently
met with,
among Christian
symbols, associated
with a fish; the emblem of the Saviour
(See <span class='sc'>Acrostic</span>).</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Ancorale</strong></span>, Gr. and R. Literally the cable of
an anchor, and then the buoy-rope, or even the
buoy itself. The ancient anchors had a ring at
the end of the shank to which the buoy-rope was
attached. The latter served not only to indicate
the place where the anchor lay, but also to drag
the flukes out of the ground when the anchor was
raised.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Angel.</strong> A gold coin
current in England
and France in the
15th and 16th centuries.
It derived its
name from the figure
of an angel stamped
upon it. A similar
coin, either of gold
or silver, was current
in France at various
periods. From the
time of Louis IX. to
that of Louis XI., the gold angel was equal in
value to a crown of fine gold, or a little more than
fourteen francs. It was stamped with a figure of
St. Michael, holding in his right hand a sword,
and in his left a shield with three fleur-de-lys.
Henry VI., king of England, when he was in
possession of Paris, had a gold angel struck
which was not above seven francs in value. It
was stamped with the figure of an angel holding
in his hand the shields of France and England.
The same king also had a silver angel struck
which was only worth about five and a half francs.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Angels</strong>, (Gr. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγγελος</span>, a messenger) in Christian
Art are represented in nine degrees, which
are divided into three categories. The first consists
of Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones; the
second of Dominations, Virtues, Powers; and
the third of Princedoms, Archangels, and Angels.
They are represented as young, to show their
continued strength; winged as messengers of
speed; barefooted and girt to show their readiness;
in robes of white indicative of purity, or
in cloth of gold for their glory; the cloth of gold
diapered with bands of precious stones; the
emerald, emblem of <em>unfading youth</em>; the crystal,
of <em>purity</em>; the sapphire, of <em>celestial contemplation</em>;
and the ruby, of <em>divine love</em>. During the renaissance,
Pugin complains, “the edifying and
traditional representations of angelic spirits were
abandoned, and, in lieu of the albe of purity and
golden vests of glory, the artists indulged in
pretty cupids sporting in clouds, &amp;c.” The
proper attributes of the angels are trumpets, for
the <em>voice of God</em>; flaming swords, for the <em>wrath
of God</em>; sceptres, for the <em>power of God</em>; thuribles
or censers for the <em>prayers of saints</em>, and musical
instruments to emblem their <em>felicity</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Angleterre, Point d’.</strong> Lace made by Flemish
makers who were invited to settle in England
in the reign of Charles II., the English Parliament
having passed an act prohibiting the importation
of all foreign lace. England, however,
could not produce the necessary flax, and
the lace was of inferior quality. The merchants
of the time remedied this by smuggling large
quantities of lace from the Brussels market, selling
it as English Point or Point d’Angleterre, by
which latter name it is still known, effacing the
old name “Point de Bruxelles.” (Fig. <a href='#fig_025'>25</a>.)</p>

places where cleanliness is peculiarly desirable.
The same term was applied to a military ensign

<em>anus</em>, a ring). A finger-ring. They were
originally made of iron, and used as a signet for
sealing. Later on they were made of gold.
Among the Greeks and Romans they were worn
on the fourth finger of the left hand, whence the
expression <em>sedere ad anulos alicui</em>, to be seated at
any one’s left hand. The <em>anulus bigemmis</em> was a
ring set with two precious stones; <em>anulus velaris</em>
was a curtain ring. A plait of hair arranged in
circles round the back of the head was also called
<em>anulus</em>. In architecture the term was formerly
employed instead of <em>anulet</em>. The stone most
frequently used for rings was the onyx, upon
which devices were carved with wonderful skill.
The <em>bezel</em>, or part of the ring which contained the
gem, was called <span class='sc'>Pala</span>. (See <span class='sc'>Rings</span>.)</p>

remarkable for delicacy of design and execution;
such were the antefixa of the temple of Diana
Propylæa at Eleusis, and the various Etruscan
specimens to be found in our museums. They
were decorated with masks, leaves, and especially
palms painted to imitate nature or in different
colours. The Etruscans employed coloured antefixa
only; many specimens of these last may be
seen at the Louvre, and in the museums of
Perugia, Florence, and Naples. The Antefixa

lead). An artificial canal for conveying water
from one point to another, and often to a considerable

with “the bow, spear, two species of javelin,
sling, a short and straight sword, dagger, knife,
falchion, axe or hatchet, battle-axe, pole-axe,
mace or club, &amp;c. Their defensive arms consisted
of a helmet of plate, or quilted head-piece,
a cuirass, or coat of armour made of metal
plates, or quilted with metal bands, and an
ample shield” (<cite>Wilkinson</cite>). Among the Greeks,
the heavy-armed warrior wore the greaves,
cuirass, with the mitra underneath, and the zone
or cingulum above; his sword, ensis or gladius,
hung on his left side, and the large round shield,
sacus, aspis, clipeus or scutum, hung from his
shoulder; his helmet, corys, cunea, cassis or
galea; his spear, enkus, doru or hasta, or two
spears. The defensive armour, the shield and
thorax, were called hopla, and the man hoplites.
The light-armed, psiloi, anoploi, gymnai, gymnetai,
had a slighter covering of skins, or cloth,
and fought with darts, stones, bows and arrows
or slings. There were also the peltastæ, so
called from their small shield pelte. All the

different purposes, but all bearing a general
resemblance to a carpenter’s adze. The expression
<em>sub ascia dedicavit</em>, which is frequently found
engraved on tombs together with the representation
of an <em>ascia</em>, has given rise to numerous interpretations.
It is supposed that this expression
signified: This tomb [never before used] has been
dedicated to the memory of the person in whose
honour it was erected; or possibly the formula
implied that the plot upon which the memorial
stood had been granted in perpetuity. After all
the discussion to which the formula has given
rise, these are the two hypotheses most generally
accepted. (See <span class='sc'>Acisculus</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Atramentale</strong>, <strong>Atramentarium</strong></span>, Gr. and R.
(<em>atramentum</em>, q.v.). An inkstand, of any shape

ink, the other an ink of some different colour.
There were also portable inkstands called <em>theca</em>.
(See <span class='sc'>Theca</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Atramentum</strong></span>, Gr. and R. (<em>ater</em>, black). A
general term to denote any kind of black liquid;
such were <em>atramentum scriptorum</em>, <em>atramentum
librarium</em>, or simply <em>atramentum</em>—all terms for
writing ink; <em>atramentum sutorum</em>, the black
used by shoemakers for dyeing their leather,
another name for which was <em>chalcamentum</em>
(q.v.); and <em>atramentum tectorium</em>, a kind of ink
used for writing inscriptions with a brush. In
ancient times, all descriptions of ink were made
with soot and gum, forming a kind of Indian
ink which was diluted with water. Vitruvius
(Book VII.) thus describes the process by which
<em>atramentum</em> was obtained: “Soot is first procured
by burning rosin in a vaulted chamber, and
the black (<em>atramentum</em>) thus obtained is then
mixed with gum.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Atriolum</strong></span>, R. (dimin. of <em>Atrium</em>). (1) A small

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Atrium</strong></span>, R. and Mod. A term perhaps
derived from <em>Atria</em>, a city of Tuscany in which
structures of this description were first built. It
consisted of a kind of covered court (<em>cavædium</em>),
round which were grouped the different apartments
of the house. In the centre of the roof
was an aperture with sloping sides called the
<em>compluvium</em>, and in the court beneath, a basin
which collected the rain-water from the roof.
This was called the <em>impluvium</em>. There were
besides, the <em>atrium displuviatum</em> and the <em>atrium
testudinatum</em>. The atrium was unquestionably
the most essential and the most interesting part
of a Roman mansion; it was here that numbers
assembled daily to pay their respects to their
patron, to consult the legislator, to attract
the notice of the statesman, or to derive importance
in the eyes of the public from an
apparent intimacy with a man in power.—<em>Moule.</em></p>

placed; when there were many such rooms the
plural <em>balnea</em> was used. <em>Balneæ</em> were the
public baths, under the Republic, when they
consisted of ordinary baths of hot and cold
water. <em>Thermæ</em> were the magnificent and
luxurious buildings adapted for the hot air
system. They contained (1) the <em>Apodyterium</em>,
or dressing-room; (2) the <em>Frigidarium</em>, where
the cold bath was taken; (3) the <em>Tepidarium</em>,
a bath of warm air; (4) the <em>Caldarium</em>, with a
vapour bath at one end, a warm water bath at
the other, and a <em>Sudatorium</em>, or sweating bath
in the middle. The pavement, called <em>suspensura</em>,
was over a furnace, <em>hypocaustum</em>. The bathers
were currycombed with <em>strigils</em>, which the
Greeks called <em>stlengis</em> or <em>xystra</em>; and they
dropped oil over their bodies from narrow-necked
vessels called <em>guttus</em> or <em>ampullæ</em>. The
<em>Thermæ</em> contained <em>exedræ</em>, or open air chambers,
where philosophers lectured, and libraries, and
had gardens, and shady walks, and fountains,
with statuary attached to them. The ruins of
the <em>Thermæ</em> built by Titus, Caracalla, and

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Bands.</strong> Originally the name given to the
collars which (in the 17th century) replaced the
ruff of Elizabeth’s
reign. At first
they were made
of stitched linen
or cambric edged
with lace, stiffened
so as to stand
up round the neck.
Contemporary
with these were the
falling bands. The
engraving (by Hollar,
1640) shows a
merchant’s wife
with collar or falling
band of cambric
edged with lace.
The term bandbox
has descended
to us from those
days, when similar
boxes were made
expressly for keeping
bands and ruffs
in. (Fig. <a href='#fig_058'>58</a>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Bands</strong>, Arch.,

<p class='c007'><strong>Banner.</strong> In

oblong
flag, larger
than the pennon
(q.v.),
charged with
the coat of
arms of the
owner displayed
over its entire
surface,
precisely as it
is blazoned on
a shield, as in
the illustration
of the Royal
Standard,
which should properly be styled the Royal <em>Banner</em>.
(See <span class='sc'>Standard</span>.) The Union Jack is also
a banner, in which the blazonry of the two
nations of England and Scotland are combined,
not by “quartering,” but by an earlier process
of “blending” the cross and the saltire in a
single composition. The profusion of banners
at tournaments, in feudal times, when each
noble planted his own in the lists, was an element
of picturesque effect. The term applies
to all kinds of flags, or colours, proper to
individuals, or corporations, &amp;c., who display
them. It does not appear that <em>military</em> banners
were used by the ancients. The banners used
in Roman Catholic countries bear the representation
of patron saints, or symbols of religious
mysteries.</p>

Christian archæology, <em>baptistery</em> was the name
given to a building adjoining a basilica, or
situated near it, in which baptism was administered.
Such is the baptistery of St. John
Lateran at Rome. One of the most ancient
baptisteries in France is that of St. Jean, at
Poitiers, represented in Fig. <a href='#fig_060'>60</a>. It dates from

<p class='c007'><strong>Barba</strong>, Gen. The beard, whence the attributive
<em>barbatus</em>, frequently employed to denote one
who wears a beard. Thus <em>bene barbatus</em>, a man
with a well-trimmed beard; <em>barbatulus</em>, a young
man whose youthful beard had never been
touched with the razor. Among many nations
of antiquity the custom prevailed of curling the
beard artificially, so as to obtain long curls or
ringlets, <em>cincinni</em>. (See <span class='sc'>Cincinnus</span>.) The Assyrians,
Egyptians, Jews, Persians, Greeks, and
Romans may be particularly enumerated. Shaving
the beard was introduced into Rome about
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 300, and became the regular practice. In
the later times of the republic many persons
began to wear it trimmed, and the terms <em>bene
barbati</em> and <em>barbatuli</em> were applied to them.
Under Hadrian the practice of wearing beards
was revived, and the emperors until Constantine
wore them. The Romans let the beard grow as
a sign of mourning; the Greeks shaved. The
beard is an attribute of the prophets, apostles,
and evangelists (excepting St. John); and, in
ancient art, of Jupiter, Serapis, Neptune, &amp;c.
Neptune has a straight beard; Jupiter a curly
silky one. The early Britons shaved generally,
but always had long moustachios. The Anglo-Saxon
beard was neatly trimmed or parted into
double locks. The Normans originally shaved
clean, but when settled in England let all their
beard grow. Close shaving prevailed among
the young men in England in the 14th century;
older men wore a forked beard. After sundry
changes, clean shaving obtained in the reign of
Henry VI., and the beard was rarely cultivated
from then until the middle of the 16th century.
The most extravagant fashions arose in Elizabeth’s
reign, and were succeeded by variations
too numerous to detail.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Basilica</strong> (sc. aula), Gr. and R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασιλικὴ</span>, sc.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στοὰ</span>, i. e. royal hall). This term owes its original
meaning to the fact
that in Macedonia the
kings, and in Greece the
archon Basileus dispensed
justice in buildings of this
description. The Romans,
who adopted the
basilica from the above-named
countries, used it
as a court of justice, but
besides this it became a
branch of the forum, and
even when it did not form
a part of the latter was
constructed near it, as
was the case at Pompeii.
Fig. <a href='#fig_071'>71</a> represents the
ground-plan of this basilica,
and Fig. <a href='#fig_070'>70</a> a view
of the same building
restored. The ground-plan
of the basilica is
rectangular, the width
not more than half nor
less than a third of the
length. It was divided
by two single rows of
columns into three naves, or aisles, and the
tribunal of the judge was at one end of the
centre aisle. In the centre of the tribunal
was the <em>curule chair</em> of the prætor, and seats
for the judices and advocates. Over each of
the side aisles there was a gallery, from which
shorter columns supported the roofs; these were
connected by a parapet wall or balustrade. The
central nave was open to the air. Under Constantine
the basilicæ were adopted for Christian
churches. The early Norman churches were built
upon the same plan, and the circular apsis,
where the judges originally sat, used for the
central altar, was the origin of the apsidal termination
of the Gothic cathedrals. The first basilica was built at Rome, <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 182. In the Middle
Ages structures resembling small churches erected
over tombs were called Basilica.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Byzantine Period.</strong>
Time, about
6th to 12th century
<span class='fss'>A. D.</span> (<em>Byzantium</em>,
the Latin
name of Constantinople.)
Byzantine
Architecture
is noteworthy
for a bold
development of
the plan of Christian
places of worship.
It introduced
the cupola,
or dome, which
was often surrounded
by semi-domes; an almost square ground-plan
in place of the long aisles of the Roman
church; and piers instead of columns. The
apse always formed part of Byzantine buildings,
which were richly decorated,
and contained
marble in great
profusion. St. Sophia,
Constantinople
(<span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 532–537), is
the finest example of
Byzantine architecture.
St. Mark’s,
Venice (<span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 977), and
the Cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle
(<span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 796–804),
are also of
pure Byzantine style.
Byzantine Painting
was that which succeeded
the decline of
the early Christian
Art in the catacombs
and basilicas of Rome,
and which preceded
and foreshadowed the
Renaissance of Art in
Italy. In style it was
based on that of the
catacombs, but with a
reminiscence of the
excellence of ancient
Greece; it was, however,
restrained and
kept within narrow
limits by the conventionalities
which were
imposed upon it by
the Church, and which
almost reduced it to a mechanical art. The
mosaics of the 10th and 11th centuries in St.
Mark’s, Venice, are perhaps the best existing
examples of the Byzantine period. Specimens
are also to be seen in St. Sophia, Constantinople;
and at Ravenna.</p>

Samothrace, in remote antiquity; it was very
popular throughout Greece in the Pelasgic period.
The principal temples were at Samothrace, Lemnos,
Imbros, Anthedon, and other places.</p>

two methods of construction to which this name
applied. The first, called <em>cæmenticia structura
incerta</em>, consisted in embedding stones of more
or less irregular shape in mortar, so as to give
them any architectural form, and then covering
the whole over with cement. The second,
called <em>cæmenticia structura antiqua</em>, consisted
in laying rough stones one on the top of
the other, without mortar, the interstices being
filled by drippings or smaller stones.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Calamister</strong> and <strong>Calamistrum</strong>. A curling-iron,
so named because the interior was partly hollow
like a reed (<em>calamus</em>), or perhaps because in very
early times a reed heated in the ashes was employed
for the purpose; hence, <span class='sc'>Calamistratus</span>,
an effeminate man, or discourse. (Compare
<span class='sc'>Ciniflo</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Calamus</strong> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάλαμος</span>, a reed or cane). A haulm,

plaited, employed for many purposes, but above
all as a woman’s work basket. The <em>calathus</em>
was the emblem of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυναικεῖον</span> or women’s

the candlestick had several branches, it was called
a candle-<em>tree</em>. There were iron, bone, silver-gilt,
and ornamented candlesticks. Through
the Middle Ages candles were stuck on a spike,
not in a socket, and a chandelier of the 16th

A dog. This term
has numerous diminutives:
<em>catulus</em>, <em>catellus</em>,
<em>canicula</em>. However
ancient any civilization,
the dog is
always met with as
the companion of
man, and in each nation
it follows a particular
type. Thus a
distinct difference is
perceptible in the dogs
of the Etruscans,
Greeks, Romans,
Egyptians, Indians,
and Gauls. The
Egyptians had terriers
and greyhounds,
wolf-dogs, and others
for hunting or watchdogs.
All these breeds
are met with on the
bas-reliefs of Egyptian
monuments. The
Egyptian name for a
dog, <em>wou</em>, <em>wouwou</em>, is evidently onomatopoietic
or imitative. (See also <span class='sc'>Dog</span>.)</p>

which is supposed to have served, in antiquity,
as a basis or model in forming statues, the
various members of which bore a definite proportion
one to the other. The Greeks had
some such <em>canon</em>. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δορυφόρος</span> (spearman)
of Polycletus was, it is said, looked upon as
affording a standard for the proportions of the
human body. The Egyptians are also supposed
to have had a canon, in which the middle finger
formed the unit of measurement.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Canopea</strong> or <strong>Canopic Vases</strong>. An Egyptian
vase, made of clay, and so named from its being
manufactured at Canopus, a town of Lower
Egypt, the present Aboukir. The same name
was given to funereal urns made in the shape of
the god <em>Canopus</em>, who is described by Russin as
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pedibus exiguis, attracto collo, ventre tumido in
modum hydriæ, cum dorso æqualiter tereti</span></i> (i. e.
having small feet, a short neck, a belly as round
and swelling as a water-jar, and a back to
match). Canopean vases were made of earthenware,
alabaster, and limestone. They were
placed at the four corners of tombs or sarcophagi
containing mummies. In them were deposited
the viscera of the dead, which were
placed under the protection of the four genii,
symbolized each by the head of some animal
which served at the same time for the lid of the
canopea.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Carmine.</strong> A beautiful pigment prepared from
the insect, cochineal. Carmine is the richest
and purest portion of the colouring matter of
cochineal. The various kinds of carmine are
distinguished by numbers, and possess a value
corresponding thereto; the difference depending
either on the proportion of the <em>alumina</em> added,
or on the presence of <em>vermilion</em> added for the
purpose of diluting and increasing the quantity
of the colour: the alumina produces a paler tint,
and the vermilion a tint different to that of
genuine carmine. The amount of adulteration
can always be detected by the use of liquor
ammoniæ, which dissolves the whole of the carmine,
but leaves the adulterating matter untouched.
Carmine is chiefly used in miniature
painting and in water-colours. It is made in
large quantities in Paris.</p>

body, a symbol which would seem to point out
the cat as the destroyer of the enemies of the
daylight and the sun. Again, the goddess <em>Bast</em>
is represented with a cat’s head, the animal
being sacred to her.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Chalcography</strong> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκὸς</span>, copper). Engraving
on copper. <em>Chalcography</em> was discovered in
Florence, in the 15th century, and early introduced
into England. Caxton’s “Golden
Legend,” containing copper-plate prints, was
published in 1483. The process is as follows:—A
perfectly smooth plate of copper, having been
highly polished, is heated in an oven, and then
white wax rubbed over it until the whole surface
is covered with a thin layer. A tracing is laid
over the wax, with the black-lead lines downwards,
which transfers the design to the wax.
Then the tracing-paper is removed, and the
engraver goes over the lines lightly with a fine
steel point, so as just to penetrate the wax, and
scratch a delicate outline upon the copper. The
wax is then melted off, and the engraving finished
with the <em>graver</em>, or <em>burin</em>, a steel instrument with
a peculiar pyramidal point. Should the lines be
cut too deeply, a smooth tool, about three inches
long, called a <em>burnisher</em>, is used to soften them
down, and to burnish out scratches in the copper.
The <em>ridges</em> or <em>burrs</em> that rise on each side of the
engraved lines are scraped off by a tool about six
inches long, called a <em>scraper</em>, made of steel, with
three sharp edges. This method has for printing
purposes been generally superseded by other
processes, principally <em>etching</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Chess.</strong> Writers immediately after the Conquest
speak of the Saxons as playing at chess, which,
they say, they learned from the Danes. The
game of chess is very prominent in the romances
of the Middle Ages. The Scandinavian navigators
introduced some remarkable elaborately carved
chessmen, of walrus ivory, from Iceland, in the
12th century. The castles are replaced by
warriors on foot, called <em>hrokr</em>, from the Saracen
<em>roc</em>, Persian <em>rokh</em>, our <em>rook</em>. In the Saracen
game the <em>vizier</em> represented our queen, and the
<em>elephant</em> our bishop, the <em>roc</em>, or hero, as aforesaid,
our rook. Beautifully carved chessmen in
the costumes of the 13th and 14th century exist
in England. They were all very large, a king
being four inches in height and seven in circumference.
The <em>chess-boards</em> were of corresponding
size, and made of all materials, including the
precious metals, crystal, sapphires, and topazes.
The pieces varied in form: the mediæval rook
had a head like a <em>fleur-de-lis</em>, the knight was
represented by a small upright column with the
upper part bent on one side. The <em>aufin</em> or
bishop was of the same shape, but the bent end
was cleft to indicate a mitre. The figures of the
16th century much more nearly resemble those
now in vogue.</p>

in the form of a vast rectangle terminating at
one extremity in a semicircle, and surrounded

centre of the circus ran a long low wall called
the <em>spina</em>, adorned with statues, obelisks, &amp;c.

was divided into two distinct parts, and at each
end of it was a <em>meta</em> or goal, round which the
chariots turned. (See <span class='sc'>Meta</span> and <span class='sc'>Ovum</span>.) The

<p class='c007'><strong>Cobalt.</strong> A metal
found in various
combinations,
from which various
colouring matters
are obtained
of great use in the
arts. <em>Cobalt blue</em>,
a beautiful blue
pigment, is obtained
by mixing a salt of pure cobalt with a
solution of pure alum, precipitating the liquid
by an alkaline carbonate, washing the precipitate
with care, drying and igniting it strongly.
A fine green, known as <em>Rinmann’s green</em>, is
similarly prepared. The chloride, the nitrate,
and the sulphate of cobalt form <em>sympathetic inks</em>,
which only become visible when the moisture is
absorbed by the application of heat. From
phosphate of cobalt a beautiful blue pigment
is produced, called <em>Thenard’s blue</em>. It is said
to have all the characters of ultramarine. Oxide
of cobalt has the property of colouring glass
blue; hence a glass formed of this oxide under
the name of <em>smalt</em> is the blue colouring matter
used for ornamenting porcelain and earthenware,
for staining glass, for painting on enamel,

which the <em>cœna</em> took place varied with the habits
of the master of the house, but it was usually
about four or five o’clock. It was the third meal
of the day, being preceded by the <em>jentaculum</em>
(breakfast), and the <em>merenda</em> or <em>prandium</em>
(luncheon or early dinner). The corresponding
Greek meal was called <em>deipnon</em>, which closed

adopted by Henry
IV., on the canopy of
whose tomb it is employed
as decoration over
the arms of himself and
his queen. Its significance

<p class='c007'><strong>Collum Vinarium</strong> (from <em>collum</em>, a neck). A
colander or wine-strainer. The custom of
straining wine dates back beyond our era, and
Christ made an allusion to it when he told the
Pharisees that their <em>colla</em> allowed a camel to
pass, while they kept back a gnat. Snow was
put into a strainer or a bag, called respectively
<em>collum nivarium</em>, <em>saccus nivarius</em>, through which
the wine was allowed to filter, not only to cool
it, but because the intense cold cleared the wine,
and rendered it sparkling and transparent; it
was then called <em>vinum saccatum</em>. The Christian
Church from the first adopted this instrument in
its liturgy; another name for it was <em>colatorium</em>.
(See <span class='sc'>Nassa</span>.) The colander for wine was made
of silver, or bronze, or other metal. The linen
cloth called <em>saccus</em> was not used for wine of any
delicacy, as it spoiled its flavour.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Colluviarium</strong></span>, R. An opening made at regular

an unguent, but especially the salve <em>collyrium</em>,
which was a liquid medicament. (2) <em>Collyria</em>
was a term applied to Egyptian vases of terra-cotta,
with or without enamel; to small quadrangular
boxes of wood or pottery; and, lastly, to
small cylindrical cases of wood or bronze divided
into compartments. There were three prevailing
forms of the vases. The Egyptians used
antimony to make their eyes look larger, and
had some medicament for the relief of toothache;
and inscriptions indicating these uses
may be read upon vessels of this kind. (Fig. <a href='#fig_180'>180</a>).</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Column</strong>, Arch. A
column consists of
three principal parts:
the base (<em>a</em>), the
shaft (<em>b</em>), and the
capital (<em>c</em>). In the
<em>Doric</em>, or most ancient
style, the columns
in a row rest
upon a common
base (<em>podium</em>). In
the Ionic and Corinthian,
each column
has its own
base (<em>spira</em>). The
shaft of all columns
<em>tapers</em> gradually from
the base to the
capital. Any swelling
introduced to
modify the straightness
of the line was
called <em>entasis</em>. On
the summit of a
row of columns rests
the <em>architrave</em>, or
chief beam (<em>d</em>);
above this the
<em>frieze</em> (<em>e</em>), and the
<em>cornice</em> (<em>f</em>) projects
above the frieze.
These three together
are called the <em>entablature</em>.
The triangular
gable-end of
the roof, above the
entablature, is called
the <em>pediment</em>. A circuit
of columns, enclosing
an open
space in the interior
of a building, was
called a <em>peristyle</em>.
A temple of two
stories, with one
peristyle upon another
(Ionic or Corinthian
columns
over the heavier
Doric), was called
<em>hypæthral</em>. In Christian archæology the column
is a symbol of the Church, which was called, so
early as St. Paul, <em>columna et firmitatum veritatis</em>
(the column and support of truth).</p>

the end in such a way that the opening formed a
basket. <em>Compta</em>, <em>plena</em>, or <em>lana amicta</em> were the
epithets applied to a <em>colus</em> when filled with wool.
The thread obtained from it was called <em>stamen</em>.
The ball of loose wool at one end, prepared for
spinning, was called <em>glomus</em>. The lower end of
the distaff rested under the left arm; the right
hand spun and wound the thread on to the
spindles (called <em>fusus</em>). (See <span class='sc'>Distaff</span>.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Corinthian Order of Architecture.</strong> This order
originated in Greece, and the capital is said to
have been suggested by observing a tile placed
on a basket left in a garden, and an acanthus
growing round it. The principal distinction of
this order is its capital, richly ornamented with
leaves and flowers. Among the principal Corinthian
examples are the temple of Vesta, the
basilica of Antoninus, and the temples of Jupiter
Tonans and Jupiter Stator; all at Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Corona</strong> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κορώνη</span>), R. A crown or garland
made with natural or artificial leaves and
flowers (of horn, parchment, &amp;c., or metal).
There were many different kinds of <em>coronæ</em>, of
which the principal were the following: <em>corona
civica</em>; <em>corona classica</em>, <em>navalis</em>, or <em>rostrata</em>;
<em>corona castrensis</em> or <em>vallaris</em>; <em>corona longa</em>;
<em>corona muralis</em>; <em>corona obsidionalis</em>; <em>corona
natalitia</em>; <em>corona oleagina</em>; <em>corona ovalis</em>;
<em>corona pactilis</em>, <em>plectilis</em>, or <em>plexilis</em>; <em>corona
triumphalis</em>; <em>corona sutilis</em>, &amp;c. The most
honourable was the <em>c. obsidionalis</em>, presented
by a beleaguered army, after its liberation,
to the general who raised the siege. It was
made of grass, or wild flowers plucked on the
site. The <em>c. civica</em> was presented to a Roman
soldier who had saved the life of a citizen in
battle. It was made of
oak leaves. The <em>c. navalis</em>
was made of gold.
The <em>c. muralis</em>, presented
to the first man
over the wall of a besieged
city, was also
made of gold, and it
was ornamented with
turrets. The <em>c. castrensis</em>,
presented to
the first soldier who
forced an entrance into
an enemy’s camp, was
of gold ornamented
with palisades. Of the
<em>c. triumphalis</em> there
were three kinds: one
of laurel or bay leaves,
worn by the commanding
officer during his
triumph; one of massive
gold held over his
head; and a third of
still greater value, also of gold. The <em>c. ovalis</em>,
to commemorate an ovation to an officer, was
made of myrtle leaves. The <em>c. oleagina</em>, of olive
leaves, was given to common soldiers. Besides
these, there were the various sacerdotal <em>coronæ</em>,
emblematical of their functions: the funereal
chaplets of leaves and flowers for the dead,
called <em>c. funebres</em> or <em>sepulchrales</em>; the wreaths
of roses, violets, myrtles, ivy, &amp;c., worn at
convivial meetings, <em>c. convivialis</em>; and the
bridal wreath, of Greek origin, made of flowers
not bought, but plucked by the bride herself,
the verbena being the chosen flower among the
Romans, <em>c. nuptialis</em>; and finally the <em>c.
natalitia</em> suspended over the door of a house
where a child was born. At Athens this was
of olive for a boy, and of wool for a girl. At
Rome the wreath was made of laurel, ivy, or
parsley. The various crowns used in heraldry
are described under their respective headings.

<p class='c007'><strong>Crackle Porcelain</strong> or <strong>Cracklin</strong>. A kind of
china, the glaze of which has been purposely
cracked all over in the kiln. The Chinese have
many kinds of this manufacture, some of which
are extremely rare and valuable. White and
grey are the common colours amongst modern
crackle. The yellow and cream-coloured specimens
are much prized: these are seldom seen in
Europe. The greens, light and dark, turquoise,
and reds are generally finely glazed, and have
the crackle lines small and minute. In colouring,
these examples are exquisite, and in this
respect they throw our finest specimens of
European porcelain quite into the shade. The
green and turquoise crackle made in China at
the present day are very inferior to the old
kinds. Perhaps the rarest and most expensive
of all ancient crackles is a yellowish stone-colour.

the garden door (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κηπαία θύρα</span>). There was
usually an upper story where guests and slaves
were lodged (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπερῷον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διῆρες</span>), the stairs leading
to which were outside the house. The roofs
were flat, and it was
customary to walk
upon them. The
floors were of stone,
in later times ornamental
or coloured.
The construction and
decoration varied
with the ages;
painted ceilings were
a late introduction.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Of a Roman house,
the principal parts
were the <span class='sc'>Vestibulum</span>,
or court before
the door, open to the
street; the <span class='sc'>Ostium</span>,
<span class='sc'>Janua</span>, or <span class='sc'>Fores</span>,
the entrance; the <span class='sc'>Atrium</span>, <span class='sc'>Cavum Ædium</span>, or
<span class='sc'>Cavædium</span>, with the <span class='sc'>Compluvium</span> open over
the central tank (termed the <span class='sc'>Impluvium</span>); the
<span class='sc'>Alæ</span> (wings), <span class='sc'>Tablinum</span>, <span class='sc'>Fauces</span>, and <span class='sc'>Peristylium</span>:
of each of which a notice will be found
in its alphabetical place in this work. (See also
<span class='sc'>Cubicula</span>, <span class='sc'>Triclinia</span>, <span class='sc'>Exedræ</span>, <span class='sc'>Pinacotheca</span>,
<span class='sc'>Bibliotheca</span>, <span class='sc'>Balneum</span>, <span class='sc'>Culina</span>, <span class='sc'>Cœnacula</span>,
<span class='sc'>Diæta</span>, <span class='sc'>Solaria</span>, &amp;c.) The floors of a Roman
house were either of the composition called <span class='sc'>Ruderatio</span>,
and, from the process of beating down
<em>pavita</em>, were then called <span class='sc'>Pavimentum</span>, or
of stone or marble or mosaics (<span class='sc'>Musivum opus</span>).
The inner walls were usually covered with
frescoes. The ceilings left the beams visible,
which supported the roof, and the hollow or
unplanked spaces (<span class='sc'>Lacunaria</span> or <span class='sc'>Laquearia</span>)
were often covered with gold and ivory, or with
paintings. (See <span class='sc'>Camara</span>.) The principal apartments
had no windows, deriving their light from
the roof; in the upper stories there were
windows either open or latticed, or later filled
with mica, and finally glass.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Donjon</strong>, Mod. The principal tower of a
Norman or mediæval
castle. It was generally
separate from
the other parts of the
building. The greater
number of feudal
fortresses originally
consisted merely of a
donjon erected on
an artificial earthwork.
This donjon
was surrounded by
an open space walled,
called the Inner
Bailey, and another
beyond called the
Outer Bailey. Beneath
were the dungeons.

<p>Fig. 265. Column and Capital of the Doric Order.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Doric Order of Architecture.</strong> The earliest
and simplest of the three Greek orders. “The
Grecian Doric order, at its best period, is one
of the most beautiful inventions of architecture—strong
and yet elegant, graceful in outline and
harmonious in all its forms, imposing when on
a great scale, and pleasing equally when reduced
in size, by the exquisite simplicity of its parts.”
(<cite>Newlands.</cite>) The columns of this order had no
pedestal, nor base;
the capital, which
was half a diameter
in height,
had no <em>astragal</em>,
but a few plain
fillets, with channels
between
them, under the
<em>ovolo</em>, and a small
channel below the
fillets. The <em>ovolo</em>
is generally flat,
and of great projection,
with a
<em>quirk</em>, or return.
On this was laid
the <span class='sc'>Abacus</span>,
which was only a
plain tile, without
fillet or ornament.
A peculiarity of
this order was the
<em>flutings</em> of the column,
twenty in
number, shallow,
and with sharp
edges. The best
examples of the
Grecian Doric of
which we have
descriptions and
figures are the
temples of Minerva
(called the Parthenon)
and of
Theseus at Athens,
and that of Minerva
at Sunium.
The <span class='sc'>Roman Doric</span> differs in important particulars
from the Grecian. (See <span class='sc'>Roman Doric</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Dormant</strong> or <strong>Couchant</strong>, Her. Asleep. (See
<span class='sc'>Couchant</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Dormer</strong> (Fr. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dormir</span></i>, to sleep). The top story
in the roof of a house.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Dormer Window.</strong> A gabled window in the
sloping side of a roof, projecting <em>vertically</em>; when
it lies in the slope of the roof, it is a <em>skylight</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><strong>Dorneck</strong>, <strong>Dornex</strong>, or <strong>Dornyks</strong></span>, O. E. An inferior
damask, wrought of silk, wool, linen thread,

<p class='c007'><strong>Dorsale</strong>, <strong>Dosser</strong>, <strong>Dossier</strong>, Chr. (<em>dorsum</em>, the
back). Pieces of tapestry or hangings put up
in the arches or bays surrounding the choir of a
church in order to screen the clergy and choristers
from draughts of air. Also pieces of tapestry hung
upon parapets, the panels of pulpits and stalls, and
sometimes the backs of side-boards. It was the
custom to hang tapestry, cloth of Arras, or
needlework round the lower half of all the
ancient dining-halls to a height of about five
feet above the basement.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Dorsualia</strong></span>, R. (<em>dorsum</em>). An embroidered
saddle-cloth, which was laid across the back
of a horse on the occasion of a triumphal
entry, or on the backs of victims for sacrifice.
Examples of <em>dorsualia</em> occur on several monuments,
in especial on a bas-relief of the arch of
Titus, at Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Doryphorus</strong>, Gen. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δορυ-φόρος</span>). Literally,
spear-bearer. Fig. <a href='#fig_130'>130</a> represents a Persian spearman.
A celebrated statue of Polycletus (of the
Argive school) is called the <em>Doryphorus</em>.
“Polycletus advanced his art in several respects,
chiefly by fixing a law of proportion, of which
his Doryphorus, a youth bearing a spear, was
called the <span class='sc'>Canon</span> (q.v.); and also by his making
the weight of the body rest on one foot, in
contradistinction to the ancient practice, thereby
producing a contrast between the supporting,
weight-bearing side of the body, and the supported,
freely-resting side.” (<cite>Butler’s Imitative
Art.</cite>) The statue by Polycletus is lost. The
proportions handed down to us by Vitruvius
are thus described by Bonomi:—</p>

<p class='c011'>(1) The length of the horizontally extended arms equals
the height of the figure.</p>

<p class='c011'>(2) The head is an <em>eighth</em>, the face a <em>tenth</em> of the whole
height.</p>

<p class='c011'>(3) From the top of the scalp to the nipples is <em>one-fourth</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>(4) From the nipples to horizontal line across the
centre of the square—the pubes—is <em>one-fourth</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>(5) From that line to one just below the knee-cap is
<em>one-fourth</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>(6) From that line to the ground is <em>one-fourth</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>(7) The forearm (from the elbow) is a <em>fourth</em> of the

<p class='c007'><strong>Doublet</strong>, although deriving its name from
the French word <em>doublée</em> (lined), is in that language
more generally known as “Pourpoint,”
of which, in fact, it is merely a variety. It
first appeared in England in the 14th century
made without sleeves, which for convenience
were afterwards added; and being universally
adopted, it superseded the tunic. The engraving

<p>Fig. 268. Two Doves. Device of Giovanna de’ Medici.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Dove.</strong> A Christian symbol of frequent occurrence;
it expresses candour, gentleness, innocence,
faith, and, in especial, the Holy Spirit.
It is also a symbol of martyrdom and grief, and
in this signification appears frequently represented
on tombs and sarcophagi. With an
olive-bough in its mouth it is a symbol of peace,
and accordingly the inscription <span class='sc'>Pax</span> (Peace) is
often found accompanying representations of the
dove, more particularly in the catacombs.
With the Assyrians and Babylonians the dove
was the symbol of Semiramis, who, according
to them, took this shape on leaving earth. The
dove was the favourite bird of Venus. As a
symbol of conjugal fidelity, the device of two
turtle-doves was adopted by Giovanna of
Austria on her marriage with Francesco de’
Medici. (Fig. <a href='#fig_268'>268</a>.)</p>

<p>Fig. 269. Dove-tailed Masonry.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Dove-tail</strong> or <strong>Swallow-tail</strong>, Gen. A method
of joining employed for wood, stone, or iron,
and so called because the tenon by which the
joint is effected is cut in the shape of a dove-tail
or swallow-tail. This tail fits into a notch
(Fig. <a href='#fig_269'>269</a>). The ancients employed double dove-tails
for joining stones together; this method of
construction was called <em>Opus</em> <span class='sc'>Revinctum</span> (q.v.).</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Dove-tail Moulding</strong>, Arch. (Norman; called
also <span class='sc'>Triangular Frette</span>). Decorated with
running bands in the form of dove-tails.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Doves, the Eucharistic.</strong> Sacred vessels of
gold, silver, gilded bronze, or ivory, in the
form of a dove, a tower, &amp;c., which served as
receptacles for the reserved Host; they were
hung up in the middle of the <span class='sc'>Ciborium</span> (q.v.).
At the Amiens Museum a dove of this kind is
to be seen dating from the 12th century, and at
the church of St. Nazaire at Milan there is
one of silver, gilded within and enamelled without,
which is also very ancient.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><strong>Dowlas</strong></span>, O. E. Coarse linen cloth made in

<p class='c007'><strong>Drachma</strong>, Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δραχμή</span>; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δράσσομαι</span>, to hold
in the hand). A drachm, the principal silver
coin of the Greeks. There were two kinds of
<em>drachmata</em>, which differed in value: the Attic
drachm and the Æginetan. The Attic <em>drachma</em>
was equal in value to a franc, equal to six <em>oboloi</em>.
The piece of four drachmas was called a <em>stater</em>.
As a weight the drachma was the eighth of an
<em>uncia</em>; about = our modern <em>drachm</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Draco</strong>, Gen. (1) A dragon; the ensign of the
Roman cohort in the time of Trajan, adopted from
the Parthians. (2) A fantastic animal of Pagan
mythology: the garden of the Hesperides, the
Golden Fleece, and the fountain of Castalia were
all guarded by dragons. (3) In Christian
archæology the dragon symbolizes sin, especially
idolatry. (4) The Chinese give to several immortals
the figure of a dragon. They distinguish
the long dragon of heaven, a being especially
sacred; the Kau, dragon of the mountain;
and the Li, dragon of the sea. The dragons
are represented as “gigantic saurians, with
powerful claws, and terminated by a frightful
head, scaly and strongly toothed.” There are
the scaly dragon, the winged dragon, the horned
and the hornless dragons, and the dragon
rolled within itself which has not yet taken
flight to the upper regions. In their zodiacal
system the dragon is the sign for the month of
March. (See <span class='sc'>Tchy</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Draconarius</strong></span>, R. The standard-bearer who

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Dracontarium</strong></span>, R. A band for the head, so
called because it was twisted in imitation of the

<span class='sc'>Cromlechs</span>, &amp;c.). The most ancient and probably
the largest Celtic or Druidical temple
was at Avebury in Wiltshire. <em>Dr. Stukeley</em>,

<p>Fig. 274. Eagle—Ensign of France.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>Eagle</strong>, Her. The eagle (called in heraldry
<em>Alerion</em>) appears in
the earliest English
examples of arms,
and his appearance
often denotes an
alliance with German
princes. Both
the German emperors
and Russian
czars adopted
the eagle for their
heraldic ensign in
support of their
claim to be considered
the successors
of the
Roman Cæsars. The eagle borne as the ensign
of Imperial France sits, grasping a thunderbolt,
in an attitude of vigilance, having its
wings elevated, but the tips of the feathers
drooping, as they would be in a living bird. In
remote antiquity the eagle was an emblem of
the sun, and the double-headed eagle typifies the
rising and the setting sun. The eagle was the
attribute of Jove as his messenger. The eagle
killing a serpent or a hare is an ancient symbol
of victory. In Christian art the eagle is the attribute
of St. John the Evangelist, the symbol of
the highest inspiration. St. John is sometimes
represented with human body and eagle head.
The lectern in Christian churches is commonly
in the form of an eagle. Elisha the prophet is
represented with a two-headed eagle. (See
<span class='sc'>Aquilæ</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Earl</strong>, Her. (from the Gaelic <em>iarflath</em>, “a
dependent chief” = <em>iar</em>, “after,” and <em>flath</em>,
“lord”; pronounced <em>iarrl</em>). Before 1337 the highest,
and now the
third degree of rank
and dignity in the
British peerage. An
earl’s coronet has
eight lofty rays of
gold rising from the
circlet, each of
which supports a
large pearl, while between each pair of these
rays there is a golden strawberry-leaf. In representation
five of the rays and pearls are shown.
Elevated clusters of pearls appear in an earl’s
coronet as early as 1445; but the present form
of the coronet may be assigned to the second
half of the following century.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Egyptian Architecture</strong> and <strong>Sculpture</strong> can be
studied in the monuments remaining from remotest
antiquity to about <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 300. Great varieties
of style occur, which can be easily attributed to
their respective periods by the hieroglyphical
inscriptions. The three primitive motives of
all Egyptian buildings are the <em>pyramid</em>, <em>caves</em>,
and <em>structures of timber</em>; all contemporary with
the most ancient relics. In sculpture, the most
ancient works of all are also those most remarkable
for fidelity to nature. The conventionality introduced
afterwards with the <em>canon of proportions</em> is
still combined with a close imitation of Nature
in the details. The Grecian or Ptolemaic period
begins <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 322. [See <em>Wilkinson’s Ancient
Egyptians</em>, <em>Canina’s Egyptian Architecture</em>; and

from another
oxide of copper; violet
from manganese
or gold; yellow from
silver, or perhaps
iron; and red from
the protoxide of copper.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Electrotint.</strong> A method of preparing engraved
copper plates for the printing-press by
the electrotype process. (See <em>Art Journal</em>, 1850.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Electrotype.</strong> The process whereby works in
relief are produced by the agency of electricity,
through which certain metals, such as gold,
silver, and copper, are precipitated from their
solutions upon moulds in so fine a state of
division as to form a coherent mass of pure
metal, equal in toughness and flexibility to the
hammered metals. (<cite>Fairholt.</cite>) At the present
day electrotypes are generally taken from engravings
on wood for printing from.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Electrum</strong> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἤλεκτρον</span>). In Homer and Hesiod
this word means <em>amber</em>. Pliny says that when
gold contains a fifth part of silver, it is called
electrum. Its colour was whiter and more
luminous than that of gold, and the metal was
supposed to betray the presence of poison.
Specimens are rare. A beautiful vase of electrum
is preserved in the St. Petersburg Museum.
Some coins in electrum were struck by the
kings of Bosporus, and by Syracuse and some

<p class='c007'><strong>Eleusinian Mysteries.</strong> The holiest and most
venerated of the Greek festivals. The Lesser
Eleusinia, held at Agræ in the month Anthesterion,
were a preparation for the Greater,
which were celebrated at Athens and Eleusis.
The <em>Mystæ</em> were the initiated at the Lesser, of
which the principal rite was the sacrifice of a
sow, previously purified by washing in the Cantharus.
The Greater were celebrated every year
in the month Boedromion, and lasted nine days.
On the first day the Mystæ assembled at Athens;
on the second they went through a ceremony of
purification at the sea-coast; the third was a
day of fasting; on the fourth there was a procession
of a waggon drawn by oxen, followed
by women who had small mystic cases in their
hands; on the fifth, or torch day, the Mystæ
went in the evening with torches to the temple
of Demeter, where they passed the night; on
the sixth, which was the most solemn of all, a
statue of Iacchos, the son of Demeter, was
borne in procession to Eleusis, and the Mystæ
were there initiated in the last mysteries
during the following night. There was something
in the secrets of this part of the ceremony
which excited greatly the imagination of the
ancient writers, especially Christians, who describe
them “in an awful and horrible manner.”
Each of the initiated was dismissed by the
<em>mystagogus</em> with the words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόγξ, ὄμπαξ</span>. On
the next day they returned to Athens, and
resting on the bridge of Cephisus engaged in a
contest of ridicule with the passers-by: the
eighth and ninth days were unimportant.</p>

by Zoffany “the lining of her robe is
worked with eyes and ears, and on her
left sleeve is embroidered a serpent—all
to imply wisdom and vigilance.” In her

<p>Fig. 286. Indian Embroidery. In the Indian section of the South Kensington Museum.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Embroidery</strong> is one of the oldest of the ornamental
arts. Some specimens of ancient <em>Egyptian</em>
embroidery are exhibited in the Louvre, and
Herodotus mentions the embroidered vestments
of the gods in Egypt. The <em>Israelites</em> appointed
Aholiab, “a cunning workman, and an embroiderer
in blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
linen,” to be <em>chief embroiderer</em> to the sacred ark.
The prophet Ezekiel mentions the embroidery
of <em>Tyre</em>. It was the principal domestic occupation
of ladies in <em>Greece</em>, from the days when
Penelope embroidered a garment for Ulysses,
representing a dog chasing a deer. The <em>Romans</em>
called embroidery “Phrygium,” and imported
it largely from the East. In later times <em>Byzantium</em>
was celebrated for its embroidered ecclesiastical
vestments. Pope Paschal, in the 9th
century, was the greatest patron of the art.
When the Caliph Omar pillaged the <em>Persian</em>
palace of Khosroes, he found there a carpet of
silk and cloth of gold, sixty cubits square, having
a garden depicted upon it, and rubies,
emeralds, sapphires, beryls, topazes, and pearls
arranged with consummate skill to represent
trees, fruit and flowers, rivulets, fountains, roses
and shrubs. Our English word “embroidery”
is derived from the Celtic “brouda,” to prick.
Anglo-Saxon embroidery was celebrated throughout
Europe as <em>Opus Anglicanum</em>. The celebrated
Bayeux tapestry is attributed to the 12th century.
A copy of it may be seen in the South Kensington
Museum. The art decayed in England
during the Civil War of the 17th century.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Emerald.</strong> A precious stone of various shades
of green, much used by the ancients for gem-engraving.
The less brilliant varieties are known
as beryls. For its significance in Christian art,
see <span class='sc'>Green</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Emerald Green.</strong> A vivid bright green pigment,
prepared from the arseniate of copper, and
used both in oil and water-colours; called also
<em>Paul Veronese Green</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Emissarium</strong></span>, R. (<em>emitto</em>, to send forth). A
channel, natural or artificial, for letting off
stagnant water. Some of these channels are the
most wonderful monuments of Roman ingenuity.
The lakes of Trasimene, Albano, Nemi, and
Fucino were all drained by <span class='fss'>EMISSARIA</span>. The

stupendous work of engineering, planned by Julius
Cæsar, and completed by the Emperor Claudius.”</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Empaistic</strong>, Gr. <em>Damascening</em> (q.v.) or <em>in

method of building, originating in Greece and
adopted by the Romans, in which a space
left in the interior of the wall was filled in
with rubble, the whole block of masonry being

In the engraving, <em>c</em> and <em>b</em> are the <em>square stones</em>,
the parts between them being the ties or diatonoi,
and <em>o</em> the rubble. (See Fig. <a href='#fig_249'>249</a>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Emporium</strong></span>, Gr. and R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔμπορος</span>, a passenger
in a ship). A place at a sea-port where imported
merchandise was warehoused and exposed for
sale. The remains of the ancient <em>emporium</em> of
Rome have been discovered on the banks of the

<p class='c007'><strong>Enamel</strong> (Fr. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esmail</span></i>; Ital. <em>smalto</em>). A
glassy substance of many brilliant colours,
melted and united to gold, silver, copper,
bronze, and other metals in the furnace.
Enamel is coloured <em>white</em> by oxide of tin, <em>blue</em> by
oxide of cobalt, <em>red</em> by gold, and <em>green</em> by copper.
Different kinds of enamel are (1) inlaid or incrusted.
(2) Transparent, showing designs on
the metal under it. (3) Painted as a complete
picture. “Many fine specimens of ancient
Chinese enamel were seen in the Exhibition of
1851. They have the enamel on copper, beautifully
coloured and enlivened with figures of
flowers, birds, and other animals. The
colouring is most chaste and effective.
The Chinese say that no good specimens of
this manufacture have been made for the
last six or eight hundred years.” (<cite>Fortune.</cite>)
Beautiful transparent enamels are
made in India.
They look like
slices of emerald
or sapphire laid
in beds of gold,
having tiny figures
of beaten gold let
into their surfaces.
(See also <span class='sc'>Cloisonné</span>,
<span class='sc'>Champ-levé</span>,
<span class='sc'>Basse-taille</span>,
&amp;c.) The beautiful
example of enamel-work,

is attributed to
Benvenuto Cellini.
(See Fig. <a href='#fig_188'>188</a>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Enamel.</strong> Painting
in enamel is
done by means of
colours that are
vitrifiable, a quality
that is communicated
to them
by combining them with a vitreous base,
which is called their flux. These are
fused and fixed on the enamel by the
action of fire, which produces in the colours
applied such changes as the artist has previously
learned to calculate. (<cite>Bouvier.</cite>)</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Encaustic</strong></span>, R. (lit. burning in). The art of
painting in encaustic. Pliny says, “The colours
were applied with wax on marble, and transparent
gum on ivory. Coloured wax was applied
to the wall in the form of a paste, and in
the manner of mosaic or enamels. This was
then melted or fused with hot irons (<em>cauteria</em>),
a small fillet of a different tint being inserted
between each flat tint.” Fairholt says,
“There is no antique painting extant which
is properly called <span class='fss'>ENCAUSTIC</span>; all those supposed

<p class='c007'><strong>Estrif</strong> or <strong>Estref</strong>, Med. A kind of arrow for

<p class='c007'><strong>Etching.</strong> In this process the copper plate
is covered with an <em>etching-ground</em>, which is
a preparation of bees’-wax, Burgundy pitch,
black pitch, and asphaltum (or other ingredients);
and the lines of the design are traced
out with <em>etching-needles</em>, which remove the
etching-ground from the copper wherever they
pass, and slightly scratch the surface of the
plate. Next, a border of <em>banking-wax</em> is put
round the sides of the plate, making a trough of
it. The <em>banking-wax</em> is made of bees’-wax,
common pitch, Burgundy pitch, and sweet oil
melted in a crucible and poured into cold
water. The next operation is to pour in nitrous
acid reduced with water to a proper strength
(about one part acid to four parts water).
When the acid has been on a sufficient time to
corrode the fainter parts of the subject, it is to
be poured off, the plate washed with water, and
left to dry. These fainter parts are then to be
varnished with a mixture called <em>stopping-ground</em>,
made of lamp-black and Venice turpentine,
applied with a camel’s-hair pencil. This stops
the further action of the acid on these parts.
When the surface is dry, fresh acid is poured on
to <em>bite in</em> the bolder parts, and the processes of
<em>stopping</em> and <em>biting-in</em> are alternated for every
gradation of tint. The wax is removed from
the plate by heat, and cleaned away with a rag
moistened with olive oil; and the work is then
complete, or it may be finished off with the
<em>graver</em>. <em>Etching-points</em> or <em>needles</em> resemble
common needles, fixed in handles four or five
inches long; some are made oval to produce
broader lines. The <em>dry point</em> is only a very
fine-pointed needle for the delicate lines. Imitations
of chalk and pencil drawings are sometimes
produced by <em>etching on soft ground</em>.
<em>Etching on steel</em> is done in the same way as on
copper. For <em>etching on glass</em>, a ground of
bees’-wax is laid on, and the design traced as
above. Sulphuric acid is then poured on, and
fluor-spar sprinkled on it, or fluoric acid may be
at once used; this is allowed to remain four or
five hours, and is then removed with oil of
turpentine. (See also <span class='sc'>Stipple</span>, <span class='sc'>Mezzotinto</span>,
<span class='sc'>Aquatinta</span>.)</p>

<p>Fig. 302. Feather Fan—Italian.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Fan</strong>, Egyp. With the <em>Egyptians</em>, the fan of
ostrich feathers for brushing away flies was
looked upon as the insignia of princes and chieftains;
the <em>flabellum</em> or <em>umbellum</em> (parasol) was
carried by inferior officers. Both kinds of fan
are frequently represented on the sacred barges.
The use of the fan was first introduced into
England in the 16th century; they were first
made of feathers with long handles of gold,
silver, or ivory of elaborate workmanship, and
sometimes inlaid with precious stones. The
engraving shows one from a portrait of Queen
Elizabeth. The <em>Greeks</em> and <em>Romans</em> had fans
of various elegant materials, often of peacock’s
feathers; sometimes of wings of birds, or of
linen stretched on a frame. <em>Italian</em> fans,
mediæval, were square flags, as in Fig. <a href='#fig_303'>303</a>.
Folding fans were first introduced in the 17th
century. Inventories of churches and monasteries
of the 14th century include ecclesiastical
fans or <em>flabella</em>. These are still used in the
Catholic Church in the East. An illumination
at Rouen represents the deacon raising the
flabellum, a circular fan with a long handle,
over the head of the priest at the altar. In the
accounts of the churchwardens of Walberswick,
Suffolk, of 1493, is the entry “for a bessume of
pekok’s fethers, IVd.” (Figs. 302, 303.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Farthingale</strong> (Fr. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vertugale</span></i>) is first spoken of
in 1547. It was a sort of cage made of whalebone
worn under the petticoat, increasing the
size of the hips. In Elizabeth’s reign it reached
to a preposterous size, giving the wearer the
appearance of “standing in a drum,” according
to “Sir Roger de Coverley.” There were <em>wheel-farthingales</em>
and <em>tub-farthingales</em>. Farthingales
were worn during the reign of Charles I., but of
more moderate dimensions; and in Charles II.’s
reign the fashion vanished to reappear in the
hoop of the 18th century. The engraving gives

The engraving shows a fine specimen of
old Flemish lace composed of six different

On the occasion of his marriage, in 1234,
St. Louis instituted the order of the “Cosse de

of the order
was composed of
broom-flowers
enamelled, intermixed
with fleurs-de-lis.
In the
reign of Charles
VI. four collars
of the order of the
Cosse de Genest
were sent as
presents to King
Richard II. and
his uncles the Dukes of Lancaster, Gloucester,
and York. The fleur-de-lis entered the English

<p class='c007'><strong>Flute</strong>, Gen. Said to have been invented by
Apollo or Mercury. The simplest form of flute
was made with an oat-stalk (<em>avena</em>) or a hollow
reed (<em>calamus</em>); in the course of time it was
made of ivory, bone, or the shin-bones of
animals; whence its
Latin name of <span class='sc'>Tibia</span>
(q.v.). The Greek
flute (<em>aulos</em>) was held
like a flageolet, and a
vibrating reed was inserted
into the mouthpiece.
The single flute
was called <em>monaulos</em>;
the double one <em>diaulos</em>.
A specimen of the
last in the British
Museum was found in
a tomb at Athens.
It is made of cedar,
and the tubes, which
are fifteen inches in
length, have each a
separate mouthpiece and six finger-holes, five of
which are at the upper side, and one underneath.
The flutes of the <em>Etruscans</em> were often
of ivory; those used in religious ceremonies
were of box-wood,
ass’s bone, bronze,
and silver. The <em>Persian</em>
flute called
“<em>nay</em>,” and the
“<em>surnay</em>” a kind
of oboe, are still
popular in the East.
In <em>Mexico</em>, the young
man sacrificed to the
god was taught to
play the flute, and
as he went to his
death he broke a
flute on each of
the steps of the
temple. The practice
of making flutes
of the bones of their enemies was common with
many Indian tribes in America.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Foliage</strong>, Gen.
Nearly every style
of architecture has
made use of foliage
for purposes of ornamentation.
In antiquity,
the leaves
of the acanthus,
palm, laurel, olive,
ivy, &amp;c., were thus
employed; the Romano-Byzantine,
Byzantine,
and Pointed
styles utilized for
the same purpose the vine, oak, cinquefoil,
parsley, mahonia, mullein, thistle, &amp;c. Foliage
has been applied to the decoration of capitals,
archivolts, bands, cornices, and friezes; and
it has also been used to form <span class='sc'>Crockets</span> (q.v.),
crownings, pinnacles, &amp;c. Architectural work
thus enriched is said to be <span class='fss'>FOLIATED</span>, and the
ornament itself is called <span class='fss'>FOLIATION</span>.</p>

PAINTING</span> (q.v.) on plaster, which is a different
process. “<em>Buon</em> (or genuine) <em>fresco</em>,” painted
on the fresh surface of plaster, is distinguished
from “<em>fresco secco</em>,” or a process of painting on
dry plaster commonly practised in Italy and
Munich. It is argued that the latter was the
process used at Pompeii, and generally by the
ancients, because (1) lime is found in nearly all the

not contain only one day’s work, as it must
in <em>buon fresco</em>.</p>

The <em>fullones</em> acted as laundrymen to Greek and
Roman families, washing linen as well as
woollen clothes by treading in tubs (using urine
for soap, which was unknown to them); hence
<em>saltus fullonicus</em>, a fuller’s dance.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Funarius.</strong> (See <span class='sc'>Funalis</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Funda, Sling</strong>, Gen. The sling has been employed
by most of the peoples of antiquity as
a weapon of warfare for hurling stones, chiefly
flints or leaden bullets (<em>glandes</em>). The slings of
the Egyptians were made of leather thongs or
plaited cord. The <em>funaitores</em>, or slingers, of the
Greek and Roman armies carried each a provision
of stones in the folds (<em>sinus</em>) of his pallium,
a shield on his left arm, and brandished
his sling in the right hand. The most celebrated
slingers were the inhabitants of the Balearic
Islands, which took their ancient name from
this circumstance.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Funeral Ceremonies.</strong> 1. Greek. The expressions
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὰ δίκαια</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νομιζόμενα</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προσήκοντα</span>, the
just and lawful rites, are expressive of the Greek
idea that the proper burial of the dead was a
most sacred duty to them. The first act was
to place in the mouth of the corpse an <em>obolus</em>,
with which the spirit would pay the ferryman
in Hades. This coin was then called <em>danaké</em>.
The body was then washed and anointed,
the head crowned with flowers, and the handsomest
robes put on. All this was done by the
women of the family. By the side of the bed
upon which the corpse was then laid (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόθεσις</span>)
were placed painted earthen vessels (<em>lecuthoi</em>;
see <span class='sc'>Lecythus</span>), which were afterwards buried
with the corpse. (These vases are frequently
disinterred in modern excavations.) A honeycake
(<em>melittouta</em>) to throw to the dog Cerberus
was laid on the bed. Before the door a vessel
of water (<em>ostracon</em> or <em>ardalion</em>) was set, to be
used, like the holy water of Catholic times, by
persons <em>leaving</em> the house, for purification. On
the third day after death, the <em>ecphora</em>, or carrying
out for burial, took place in the morning
before sunrise. The men walked before the
corpse, and the women behind. Hired mourners
(<em>threnodoi</em>) accompanied the procession, playing
mournful tunes on the flute. The bodies were
either buried or burned, until cremation gave
way to a Christian prejudice. The body was
placed for burning on the top of a <em>pyre</em> (Gr.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πῦρ</span>, fire); and, in remote ages, animals,
prisoners, or slaves were burned with it. Oils
and perfumes were thrown into the flames.
Finally, the smouldering ashes were quenched
with wine, and relatives and friends collected
what remained of the bones. The bones were
then washed with wine and oil, and placed in
urns, often golden.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Roman. <em>Funera justa</em> conveys the same
idea as the Greek <em>dicaia</em> of the right and title
of the dead to a proper observance. With the
Romans, the washing, anointing, &amp;c. of the
body was done by slaves (<em>pollinctores</em>) of the
undertakers, who were called <em>libitinarii</em>, because
they dwelt near the temple of Venus
Libitina, in which all things requisite for funerals
were sold and a mortuary register was kept.
The coin having been duly placed in the mouth,
the body was laid out in the vestibule dressed,
of ordinary citizens in a white toga, and of
magistrates in their official robes, and the couch
was strewn with flowers, and a branch of <em>cypress</em>
was placed at the door of the house. All funerals
were, in ancient times, performed at night,
but afterwards only those of the poor. At a
great funeral the corpse was carried out on
the eighth day, preceded by musicians (<em>cornicines</em>,
&amp;c.) and mourning women (<em>præficæ</em>), who
chanted a funeral hymn (<em>nænia</em>); players and
buffoons (<em>histriones</em>, <em>scurræ</em>) followed, and a
procession of the freed slaves wearing the cap
of liberty (<em>pileati</em>). Images of the deceased and
of his ancestors were borne before the corpse,
which was carried on a litter (<em>feretrum</em>). The
common bier of the poor was called <em>sandapila</em>,
and its bearers <em>vespillones</em>, because they bore it
forth in the evening (<em>vespere</em>). The couches of
the rich were of ivory, richly ornamented with
gold and purple. The relations walked behind
in mourning, sons with the head veiled, and
daughters with dishevelled hair. At the forum
a funeral oration (<em>laudatio</em>) was delivered, and
thence the procession went to the place of
burial or cremation. Those who were buried
(as all were subsequently to the 4th century
<span class='fss'>A. D.</span>) were placed in a coffin (<em>arca</em> or <em>loculus</em>),
often of stone. The Assian stone, from Assos
in Troas, was said to consume all the body,
with the exception of the teeth, in forty days,
whence it was called sarcophagus (q.v.). For
cremation the pyre, or <em>rogus</em>, was built like an
altar, and the corpse in its splendid couch being
placed on the top, the nearest relation, with
averted face, fired a corner of the pile. Perfumes
were forbidden by the Twelve Tables.
Sometimes animals were slaughtered, and in
ancient times, captives and slaves, but afterwards
gladiators were hired to fight round the blazing
pile. (Compare <span class='sc'>Bustum</span>.) When the pyre
was burnt down, the embers were soaked with
wine, and the bones and ashes collected into
urns. (See <span class='sc'>Urna</span>.) The solemnities continued
for nine days after the funeral, at the end of
which time a sacrifice was performed called the
<em>novemdiale</em>. Men wore <em>black</em> for mourning, and
women white; but at all banquets given in honour
of the dead the guests were clothed in white.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Fur.</strong> <em>Strutt</em> says that “the furs of sables,
beavers, foxes, cats, and lambs were used in
England before the Conquest; to which were
afterwards added those of ermines, squirrels,
martens, rabbits, goats, and many other animals.”
In the Middle Ages the more precious furs, as
ermine and sable, were reserved for kings,
knights, and the principal nobility of both sexes.
Inferior ranks used “vair” and “gris,” or
gray; while citizens, burgesses, and priests wore
the common squirrel and lamb-skins. The
peasants wore cat-skins, badger-skins, &amp;c. In
after times were added the skins of badgers,
bears, beavers, deer, fitches, foxes, foynes (or
martens), grays, hares, otters, sables, squirrels,
weasels, wolves, &amp;c. The mantles of our kings
and peers, and the furred robes of municipal
officers are the remains of this fashion, which in
the 13th century was almost universal.</p>

to a kind of fork by aid of which a foot-traveller

for this kind of fork was <em>ærumna</em> (q.v.). Also,
a wooden fork placed for punishment across
the shoulders of slaves and criminals, to the

of Vesta at Tivoli. (See <span class='sc'>Encarpa</span>, <span class='sc'>Festoons</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Garnet.</strong> This gem, on account of its brilliant
colour and hardness, is much used in jewellery,
and although an abundant supply renders it of
little value, the gem nevertheless possesses every
quality necessary for ornamental purposes. It
occurs in many colours—red, brown, yellow,
white, green, black; the streak is white; the
diaphaneity varies from transparent to sub-translucent,
or nearly opaque, and it has a subconchoidal
or uneven fracture. The varieties
used in jewellery are called <em>carbuncle</em>, <em>cinnamon-stone</em>
(or <em>essonite</em>), <em>almandine</em>, and <em>pyrope</em>
or Bohemian garnet. <em>Garnets</em> are not much
used for engraving, being of splintery, bad grain
under the tool. (<em>A. Billing</em>, <cite>Science of Gems</cite>,

alone excepted. The
stalls of the knights
are in the choir of
St. George’s Chapel,
Windsor Castle, where
their garter-plates are
fixed and their banners
are displayed. The insignia
are the garter
itself, the badge of the
order; the collar, and
the Lesser George or
jewel. (Fig. <a href='#fig_349'>349</a>.) It
was this jewel that
Charles I., immediately

264, at a funeral. The practice had its origin
in that very ancient one of slaughtering slaves
and captives on such occasions. Subsequently
it became more general. The different classes
of gladiators, distinguished by their arms and
other circumstances, were: <em>Andabatæ</em>, who wore
helmets without any opening for the eyes, and
therefore fought blindfold; <em>Essedarii</em>, who
fought from chariots (<span class='sc'>Essedæ</span>); <em>Hoplomachai</em>,
who wore heavy defensive armour; <em>Laqueatores</em>,
who carried a sort of lasso or noose; <em>Meridiani</em>,
who fought in the middle of the day, and were
very slightly armed; <em>Mirmillones</em>, so called
from their having the image of a fish (mormyr)
on their helmets; <em>Retiarii</em>, armed with a trident
and a net. Others, as <em>Samnites</em>, <em>Thraces</em>, &amp;c.,
were named from the nation whose fashion of
armour they adopted. The fights of gladiators
were favourite subjects of Roman art, and it is
assumed that in cases where no actual combats
took place at a funeral, they were represented
on the walls of tombs in sculpture or paint.
The most celebrated statues of the kind are the
so called “Dying Gladiator” in the museum
of the capitol at Rome, and the Gladiator of
the Borghese collection.</p>

<p>Fig. 358. Venetian Glass Vase, 16th century.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Glass.</strong> The discovery is lost
in remote antiquity. Pliny
gives a legend which ascribes
it to chance. Glass bottles
in Egypt are represented upon monuments
of the 4th dynasty (at least 2000 years <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>).
A vase of greenish glass found at Nineveh
dates from <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 700. Glass is found in the
windows at Pompeii; and the Romans stained
it, blew it, worked it on lathes, and engraved
it. Pliny mentions, as made by the
Romans in his time, glass coloured opaque,
red, white, black (like <em>obsidian</em>), or imitating
jacinths, sapphires, and other gems; also
<em>murrhine glass</em>. This last was either an imitation
of fluor-spar, or a kind of agate, or fluor
spar. The Romans also made <em>mosaic</em> or <em>millefiori</em>,
in which the threads of colour are melted
into a rod, so that at every section the whole
pattern appears; and <em>cameo glasses</em>, in which a
paste of one colour is laid over another, and the
whole then carved into the required design;
<em>gold leaf</em> was also worked into the substance or
fixed on the surface. A gate at Constantinople
took its name from the glass works near it, but
little is known of the Byzantine art, nor of
earlier European art than the 13th century. In
mediæval times stained glass windows, in leaden
frames, were constructed with great success in
England, France, and Flanders. In the 13th
century they appear in Italy. The Venetian
art took its impulse from the capture of Constantinople
in 1204. Its peculiar beauty is derived
from the curved forms and tenuity of substance
obtained in blowing. (Fig. <a href='#fig_358'>358</a>.) There are
six kinds of Venetian glass. (1) Vessels of colourless
or <em>transparent glass</em>, or of single colours, generally
blue or purple. (2) <em>Gilt</em> or <em>enamelled glass</em>.
(3) <em>Crackled glass</em>, having a surface rough and
divided irregularly into ridges. (4) Variegated
or <em>marbled opaque glass</em>, called <em>schmeltz</em>; the
most common variety is a mixture of green and
purple, sometimes resembling jasper, sometimes
chalcedony; other varieties are imitations
of lapis lazuli and tortoise-shell;
and <em>avanturine</em>, which is
obtained by mingling metallic filings
or fragments of gold leaf with
melted glass. (5) <em>Millefiori</em>, or
<em>mosaic glass</em>, in imitation of the
old Roman process. (6) <em>Reticulated</em>,
<em>filigree</em>, or <em>lace glass</em>. The varieties
contain fine threads of glass, generally
coloured, but sometimes milk-white,
included in their substance.
The lightness and strength of the
Venetian glass are due to its not
containing lead like our modern
flint glass. Venetian <em>mirrors</em> were
for a long period widely celebrated.
The oldest example of the German
<em>drinking-cups</em>, ornamented with
paintings in enamel, is of the date
of 1553. The designs are commonly
armorial bearings. From
the beginning of the 17th century
the Bohemian manufactories supplied
<em>vases</em> enriched with ornamental
subjects, particularly with
portraits engraved upon the glass.
The art of <em>wheel engraving upon
glass</em> flourished in France under
Louis XVI. In modern times this
kind of ornamentation is produced
by the agency of hydrofluoric acid.
“Coarse glass-making in England
was, in Sussex, of great antiquity.”
(<cite>Fuller.</cite>) “The first making of

<p class='c007'><strong>Glazed Wares.</strong> Almost immediately after the
invention of Ceramic manufacture, the application
of <em>glaze</em> or <em>coloured enamel</em> must have improved
it. What we term <em>glaçure</em> is a light varnish
which enlivens and harmonizes the porous
surface of terra-cotta. In its simple state it is
a mixture of silex and lead, and in this state it
is transparent, as we find it on <em>antique vases</em>;
when vitrifiable, and mixed with tin, as in the
case of <em>majolicas</em>, it is called enamel; and when
of vitrifiable and earthen substance, such as can
only be melted at the temperature required for
the baking of the paste itself, it is known as
<span class='sc'>Glaze</span>, or <em>couverte</em>, and can be identified in the
Persian faiences and Flemish stone-ware. (Figs.
359, 360.) (See <em>Burty</em>, <em>Chefs-d’œuvre of the
Industrial Arts</em>.)</p>

<p>Fig. 361. Glory. Vesica Piscis in Ely Cathedral.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Glory</strong>, <strong>Nimbus</strong> or <strong>Aureole</strong>, the Christian
attribute of sanctity, is of pagan origin, common
to images of the gods, and Roman, even
Christian, emperors. Satan in miniatures of
the 9th to 13th century wears a glory. The
earliest known Christian example is a gem of
St. Martin of the early part of the 6th century.
The glory round the head is properly the nimbus
or aureole. The oblong glory surrounding the
whole person, called in Latin “vesica piscis” (Fig.
<a href='#fig_361'>361</a>), and in Italian the “mandorla” (almond) from
its form, is confined to figures of Christ and the
Virgin, or saints who are in the act of ascending
into heaven. When used to distinguish one of the
three divine Persons of the Trinity, the glory
is often cruciform or triangular: the square
nimbus designates a person living at the time
the work was executed. In other instances it is
circular. Coloured glories are variously symbolical.
(<em>Mrs. Jameson</em>, “<cite>The Poetry of Sacred
and Legendary Art</cite>.”)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Gloves.</strong> In the 14th century already <em>gloves</em>
were worn, jewelled on the back, as a badge of
rank. “They were worn in the hat,” says
Steevens, “as the favour of a mistress, or the
memorial of a friend, and as a mark to be challenged
by an enemy.” A glove of the 17th century
is described “of a light buff leather,
beautifully ornamented with spangles and
needlework in gold and silver threads, with a
gold lace border, and silk opening at the
wrist.” Gloves were called “cheirothecæ,”
hand-coverers, by the Greeks and Romans;
they were made without separate fingers, the
thumb only being free. A legend current at
Grenoble affirms that St. Anne, the mother
of the Virgin Mary, was a knitter of gloves.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Gold.</strong> It is probable that the earliest recorded
mark upon units of value was the image of a
sheep or an ox; hence money in Latin is called
<em>pecunia</em>, from <em>pecus</em>, cattle, the original form of
barbaric wealth, for which gold was the substitute.
The wealth of Abraham in silver and
gold, as well as in cattle, is mentioned in
Genesis. No coins of gold or silver have been
found in <span class='sc'>Egypt</span> or <span class='sc'>Nineveh</span>, although beautiful
specimens of the goldsmith’s art have been
recovered from the tombs of both countries.
The <span class='sc'>Hebrews</span>, taught by the Egyptians, made
their ark, mercy-seat, altar of incense, seven-branched
candlestick, and other golden ornaments,
even in the desert of Sinai. The seven-branched
candlestick is represented in sculpture on the
arch of Titus at Rome. At <span class='sc'>Babylon</span> and
<span class='sc'>Nineveh</span> gold is said to have been lavishly
applied in gilding sculpture, and even walls;
but it is suggested that an alloy of copper, the
<em>aurichalcum</em> of the Greeks, was the metal in
reality used for this purpose. The heroes of
the Greek epic had golden shields and
helmets; breastplates and other large
pieces of golden armour are among the
recent discoveries at Mycenæ; at Kourioum
in the island of Cyprus also great stores of
golden ornaments of a very early age have
been discovered. In <span class='sc'>Scythian</span> tombs in
Russia also, about Kertch, beautiful relics
of Grecian work in gold have been found,
showing that in the very earliest ages the
skill and taste applied to this art were not
less than those of later times. The gold
jewellery of ancient India also excelled that
of modern date, but none, before or since,
ever equalled the great age of <span class='sc'>Greek</span> art.
Pausanias describes a statue of Athene,
made by Pheidias, and kept in the Parthenon
at Athens, of ivory and gold—<em>chryselephantine</em>—delicately
worked all over; and
a still larger statue of Jupiter, of the
same materials. Native gold alloyed with one-fifth
silver was greatly prized by the Greek artists,
who gave it the name of <em>electrum</em>. Examples of
this electrum are rare; there is a vase at St. Petersburg.
The <span class='sc'>Romans</span> used to pay enormous
prices for their household plate; for an example,
the bowl of Pytheas, on which were
represented Ulysses and Diomed with the palladium,
fetched 10,000 denarii, or about 330<em>l.</em>
<em>per ounce</em>. Few specimens of Roman art have
escaped destruction. (Fig. <a href='#fig_007'>7</a>.) Of the age of
<span class='sc'>Byzantine</span> splendour we are told that the
Emperor Acadius, early in the 5th century, sat
on a throne of massive gold, his chariot being
also of gold, &amp;c. In the 9th century the
throne of Theophilus was overshadowed by a
tree of gold, with birds in the branches, and at
the foot two lions all gold. The lions roared
and the birds piped in the branches. A remarkable
wealth of ancient goldsmith’s work has been
found in <span class='sc'>Ireland</span>, consisting principally of
personal ornaments. In the 9th and 10th centuries
the Irish workmanship was unsurpassed in
Europe. It consisted principally of objects for
religious use, and is characterized by a filagree
of extraordinary richness, akin to the intricate
traceries of the Irish illuminated work on MS. of
the same date and derivation. In the 10th and
11th centuries there was a great revival of art
throughout Europe. In <span class='sc'>Germany</span>, the abbey of
Hildesheim, under Bishop Bernward, became
the centre of a school of goldsmiths, and some
beautiful specimens of hammered gold, by the
bishop’s hand, are preserved.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Gold</strong>, in Christian art. (See <span class='sc'>Yellow</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Gold, Cloth of</strong>, is mentioned in the Pentateuch,
and was common throughout the East in
all ages. It was originally wrought, not in
rounded wire but flat, as the Chinese, the
Indians, and the Italians (their <em>lama d’oro</em>)
weave it now. The early Roman kings wore
tunics of gold, and the Romans used it as a
shroud for burial. King Childeric, <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 482,
was buried at Tournai in a mantle of golden
stuff. It was much favoured in England for
church vestments, and by royalty, especially by
Edward IV. and Henry VIII. and the nobility
of their time. (The different varieties are
described in their order. See <span class='sc'>Acca</span>, <span class='sc'>Areste</span>,

emitting sparks of fire, at the end whereof
hangs on the breast a Golden Fleece. The fusils
are joined two and two together, as if they were
double BB’s (the cyphers of Burgundy). The
<em>flint-stones</em> are the ancient arms of the Sovereigns
of Burgundy, with the motto “<em>Ante ferit
quam flamma micet</em>.” (See Fig. <a href='#fig_342'>342</a>.) The
motto of the Order is “<em>Pretium non vile laborum</em>.”
There are four great officers, viz. the Chancellor,
Treasurer, Register, and a King of Arms, called
<em>Toison d’Or</em>. The <span class='sc'>Badge</span> consists of a Golden
Fleece, suspended from a flint-stone, which is

<p class='c007'><strong>Hair.</strong> The <em>Assyrian</em> monarchs are represented
with beard elaborately plaited, and hair
falling in ringlets on the shoulder, which may
have been partly artificial, like that of the
Persian monarchs, who, according to Xenophon,
wore a wig. Both the hair and beard were
dyed, and the eyes blackened with kohl, &amp;c.
(<cite>Layard.</cite>) The <em>Egyptians</em> kept the head shaved,
and wore wigs and beard-boxes. The <em>Hebrews</em>
generally wore the hair short, but the horse-guards
of King Solomon “daily strewed their
heads with gold dust, which glittered in the
sun.” (<cite>Josephus.</cite>) The ancient <em>Greeks</em> wore
their hair long. The <em>Athenians</em> wore it long
in childhood, had it cut short at a solemn
ceremony when they became eighteen years of
age, and afterwards allowed it to grow, and
wore it rolled up in a knot on the crown of the
head, fastened with golden clasps (<em>crobylus</em>,
<em>corymbus</em>). Women wore bands or coifs (<em>sphendone</em>,
<em>kekryphalus</em>, <em>saccus</em>, <em>mitra</em>). Youths and
athletes are represented with short hair. The
favourite colour was blonde (<em>xanthus</em>); black
was the most common. The ancient <em>Romans</em>
also wore long hair; about 300 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> the practice
of wearing it short came in (<em>cincinnus</em>,
<em>cirrus</em>). The Roman women anciently dressed
their hair very plainly, but in the Augustan
period adopted some extravagant fashions.
Each of the gods is distinguished by his peculiar
form of hair: that of Jupiter is long and flowing;
Mercury has close curling hair, &amp;c. The <em>Danes</em>,
<em>Gauls</em>, and <em>Anglo-Saxons</em> wore long flowing
hair, and the shearing of it was a punishment:
when Julius Cæsar conquered the Gauls, he cut
off their long hair. Among the early <em>Frankish</em>
kings long hair was the privilege of the blood
royal. From the time of <em>Clovis</em> the French
nobility wore short hair, but as they grew less
martial the hair became longer. François I.
introduced short hair, which prevailed until the
reign of Louis XIII., which was followed by the
period of periwigs and perukes of Louis XIV.
The variations from the Conquest to the last
generation in <em>England</em> are so striking and frequent
that each reign may be distinguished by
its appropriate head-dress. (Consult <em>Fairholt’s
Costume in England</em>, <em>Planché’s Cyclopædia of
Costume</em>, &amp;c.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Hair-cloth.</strong> (See <span class='sc'>Cilicium</span>.)</p>

with the uncut ends of the hair. (See
<span class='sc'>Fitch</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Halbert.</strong> A footman’s weapon in the form of
a battle-axe and pike at the end of a long staff.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Halcyon.</strong> The ancient name of the <em>Alcedo</em>

<p class='c007'><strong>Halcyon Days</strong>, i. e. the calm and peaceful
season when the king-fisher lays its eggs in nests
close by the brink of the sea; i. e. seven days

<p class='c007'><strong>Hall-marks.</strong> The Goldsmiths of London
formed their company in 1327, and were incorporated

mark. 2. The maker’s mark, originally a
rose, crown, or other emblem with or without
initials. 3. The annual letter, in the order of

the leopard’s head (1) for the king’s mark, the
lion’s head <em>erased</em>, introduced in 1697 when the
standard was changed, and, 6, a figure of
Britannia substituted for the lion <em>passant</em> (4) at
the same time. Plate with this mark is called
<em>Britannia</em> plate. The old standard (of 11 oz.

supposed to have been of silk. The <span class='sc'>Greek</span>
harp, called <em>kinyra</em>, resembled the Assyrian, and
is represented with 13 strings: it is an attribute
of Polyhymnia. The <span class='sc'>Anglo-Saxons</span> called
the harp the <em>gleo-beam</em>, or “glee-wood;” and it
was their most popular instrument. King David
playing a harp is represented on an A.S. monument
of the 11th century. It was the favourite
instrument of the <span class='sc'>German</span> and <span class='sc'>Celtic</span> bards,
and of the <span class='sc'>Scandinavian</span> skalds. It is represented
with 12 strings and 2 sound-holes, and
having a fore-pillar. A curious <span class='sc'>Irish</span> harp of the
8th century, or earlier, is represented in Bunting’s
“Ancient Music of Ireland,” having no
fore-pillar. The <span class='sc'>Finns</span> had a harp (<em>harpu</em>,
<em>kantele</em>) with a similar frame, devoid of a front
pillar. In <span class='sc'>Christian art</span> a harp is the attribute
of King David and of St. Cecilia. St.
Dunstan is also occasionally represented with it.
In Heraldry the harp is the device and badge of
Ireland. The Irish harp of gold with silver
strings on a blue field forms the third quarter
of the royal arms.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Harpaga</strong>, <strong>Harpago</strong></span>, Gr. and R. A general
term, including any kind of hook for grappling;
more particularly a military engine invented by
Pericles, and introduced into the Roman navy by
Duillius. It consisted of a joist about two yards
and a half long, each face of which was coated
with iron, and having at one end a harpoon of
iron or bronze; the other end was fitted with an
iron ring, to which a rope was attached, so as to
enable it to be drawn back when it had once
grappled a ship or its rigging. <em>Harpago</em> or <em>wolf</em>
was the term applied to a beam armed with a
harpoon, which was employed to break down
the tops of walls, or widen a breach already
made. [A flesh-hook used in cookery to take
boiled meat out of the caldron.]</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Harpastum</strong></span>, R. A small ball employed for a
game in which the players formed two sides.
They stationed themselves at some distance from
a line traced on the ground or sand where the
<em>harpastum</em> was placed. At a given signal each
player threw himself upon the ball, in order to
try and send it beyond the bounds of the opposite
party.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Harpies</strong>, Gen. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἅρπυιαι</span>, i. e. the Snatchers).
Winged monsters, daughters of Neptune and
Terra, three in number, viz. <em>Aëllo</em> (the tempest),
<em>Ocypetê</em> (swift-flying), and <em>Cêlêno</em>; representing
the storm-winds. They had the faces of old
women, a vulture’s body, and huge claws; they
were the representatives of the Evil Fates, and
the rulers of storms and tempests. In Christian
iconography the Harpies symbolize the devil
and repentance. [In the so called “Harpy tomb”
in the British Museum they are represented
carrying off Camiro and Clytia, the daughters of
Pandarus of Crete, as a punishment for his
complicity with Tantalus in stealing ambrosia
and nectar from the table of the gods.]</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Harpsichord.</strong> A musical instrument intermediate
between the <em>spinet</em>, <em>virginals</em>, &amp;c., and
the <em>pianoforte</em>, which supplanted it in the 18th

harp enclosed in a sonorous case, the wires
being struck with jacks armed with crow-quills,
and moved with finger-keys.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Hasta</strong> (Gr. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔγχος</span>).
A spear used as a pike
for thrusting, or as a
missile for hurling from
the hand, or as a bolt
from an engine. Homer
defines the spear as “a pole heavy with
bronze.” The <em>hasta amentata</em>, for hurling,
had a leathern thong for a handle (<em>amentum</em>) in
the middle; <em>hasta pura</em> was a spear without a
head, and was a much-valued decoration given
to a Roman soldier who had saved a citizen’s
life; <em>hasta celibarium</em> was a spear which, having
been thrust into the body of a gladiator as he lay
dead in the arena, was afterwards used at marriages
to part the hair of the bride. A spear
was set up before a place where sales by auction
were going on, and an auction-room was hence
called <span class='sc'>Hastarium</span>. Different
kinds of spear were the <em>lancea</em>
of the Greeks; the <em>pilum</em>,
peculiar to the Romans; the
<em>veru</em>, <em>verutum</em>, or “spit,” of
the Roman light infantry;
the <em>gæsum</em>, a Celtic weapon
adopted by the Romans; the
<em>sparrus</em>, our English spar or
<em>spear</em>, the rudest missile of
the whole class; and many
others mentioned under their
respective headings in this
work.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Hasta Pura.</strong> In Numismatics,
a headless spear or
long sceptre, an attribute of all
the heathen deities; a symbol
of the goodness of the gods
and the conduct of providence,
equally mild and forcible.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Hastarium</strong></span>, R. A room in
which sales were made <em>sub
hasta publica</em>, that is, by public auction, under
the public authority indicated by the spear. The
term also denoted a list or catalogue of sale.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Hastile</strong></span>, R. (<em>hasta</em>). The shaft of a spear, and
thence the spear itself, a goad, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Hat</strong> (A.S. <em>haet</em>, a covering for the head).
Froissart describes hats and plumes worn at
Edward’s court in 1340, when the Garter order
was instituted. Hats were originally of a scarlet-red
colour, and made of “a fine kinde of haire
matted thegither.” A remarkable series of
changes in the fashion of hats is given in
<em>Planché’s Encyclopædia of Costume</em>. Our illustration
represents a young Venetian noble of the
Middle Ages. (See also the illustrations to

<p>Fig. 382. Inscription, with hearts, found at Alise.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Heart.</strong> On numerous Christian tombs hearts
maybe seen sculptured. Many archæologists have
attempted to explain their meaning as symbols,
but without entering on an unprofitable discussion
of that question, it may be noticed that,
in many cases, what archæologists have supposed
to be hearts were nothing but ivy-leaves,
which served as marks of separation between
different words or sentences. Fig. <a href='#fig_382'>382</a> represents
an inscription at Alise in which ivy-leaves
figure, together with an ornament which
some would insist were flames, if they were to
take the leaves for hearts. When inscriptions,
however, are defaced, the shape of the leaves
is not nearly so distinguishable as in the figure.
[One of the most frequent methods in which
this emblem is introduced in Christian art
is that the Saviour, or the Virgin Mary, is represented
opening the breast to display the
living heart—the natural symbol of Love, Devotion,
or Sorrow. The Heart is an attribute
of St. Theresa, St. Augustine, and other saints.
The flaming heart is the emblem of charity.
The heart pierced by seven daggers symbolizes
the “seven sorrows” of Mary.]</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Hecatesia</strong>, Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἑκατήσια</span>). Festivals held

cattle (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑκατὸν</span>) were slain; whence the name of
the festival. [The term was generally applied

depicted in contemporary
illuminations, sculptures, and tapestries. Afterwards

<p class='c007'><strong>Herald</strong> (Germ. <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Herold</span></i>). An officer of arms.
The heralds of England were incorporated
by Richard III. The college now consists
of three kings of arms, six heralds, and four
pursuivants. The office of Earl Marshal, the
supreme head of the English heralds, is hereditary
in the family of the Duke of Norfolk.
There is another herald king styled “Bath,”
who is specially attached to that order; he is
not a member of the college. The chief herald
of Scotland is styled Lord Lyon King of Arms;
that of Ireland, Ulster King of Arms. <em>Chester
herald</em> is mentioned in the reign of Richard II.,
<em>Lancaster king of arms</em> under Henry IV. (See
<span class='sc'>Marshal</span>, <span class='sc'>Kings of Arms</span>, &amp;c.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Heralds’ College.</strong> A college of heralds was
instituted in Rome by Numa Pompilius, and
the office was held sacred among the most
ancient Oriental nations. The institution was
imported into England in the Middle Ages
from Germany, a corporation of heralds, similar
to the <em>collegium fetialium</em> of Rome, having
been established in England in 1483 by Richard
III. (See <em>Pitiscus</em>, tom. i., and <em>Hofmann</em>,
tom. ii.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Hermæ</strong></span>, Gr. and R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἑρμαῖ</span>). Hermæ, a
kind of pedestals surmounted only by the head,
or, in some cases, the bust of Hermes. Great
reverence was felt for these statues. Houses at
Athens had one before the doors; they were also
placed in front of temples, near tombs, at
street corners, or as mile-stones on the high roads.
<em>Hermuli</em>, or small <em>Hermæ</em>, were a common ornament
of furniture, as pilasters and supports.
The same name is applied to similar statues
having a man’s head. This statue was probably
one of the first attempts of art at plastic representation.
The <em>phallus</em> and a pointed beard
originally were essential parts of the symbol.
In place of arms there were projections to hang
garlands on. Then a mantle was introduced
from the shoulders. Afterwards the whole torso
was placed above the pillar; and finally the
pillar itself was shaped into a perfect statue.
All these gradations of the sculptor’s art are
traceable in existing monuments.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Hermæa.</strong> Festivals of Hermes, celebrated

served as a funeral monument. Several representations
of Roman <span class='sc'>Heroa</span> may be seen in
the British Museum, representing funeral feasts
in a temple, carved on the face of a sarcophagus

the education of the Egyptians three styles of
writing are taught: the first is called the
epistolary (<em>enchorial</em> or <em>demotic</em>); the second
the <em>sacerdotal</em> (<em>hieratic</em>), which the sacred Scribes

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Hippodromus</strong></span>, Gr. and R. The Greek name
for an arena for horse and chariot races, in contradistinction
to the stadium, which served for
foot-racing. Fig. <a href='#fig_386'>386</a> represents the hippodrome
at Olympia, taken from Gell’s <em>Itinerary of the

light cavalry.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Histrio.</strong> An actor. The <span class='sc'>Greek</span> dramas
were originally represented on the stage by
one performer, who represented in succession
the different characters. Æschylus introduced
a second and a third actor. The actors
were all amateurs, and it was not until a
later period that the histrionic profession became
a speciality. Sophocles and Æschylus
both probably acted their own plays. The
<span class='sc'>Roman</span> name for an actor, <em>histrio</em>, was formed
from the Etruscan <em>hister</em>, a dancer. The earliest
<em>histriones</em> were dancers, and performed to the
music of a flute; then Roman youths imitating
them introduced jocular dialogue, and this was
the origin of the drama. After the organization
of the theatres, the <em>histriones</em> were subjected to
certain disabilities; they were a despised class,
and excluded from the rights of citizenship.
The greatest of <em>histriones</em> in Rome were Roscius
and Æsopus, who realized great fortunes by
their acting.</p>

holiday kept to commemorate the expulsion of
the Danes. It was held on the second Tuesday

<p>Fig. 388. Honiton Guipure.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Honiton Guipure.</strong> Lace was made in Devonshire,
as well as in other parts of England, of
silk and coarse thread until 1567, when the
fine thread now used was introduced, it is said,
by Flemings, who had escaped from the persecutions
of the Duke of Alva. (See <span class='sc'>Old Devonshire</span>.)
Honiton lace owes its great reputation
to the sprigs made separately on a pillow,
and afterwards either worked in with the
beautiful pillow net or sewn on it. This net
was made of the finest thread from Antwerp,
the price of which in 1790 was 70<em>l.</em> per pound.
(See <span class='sc'>Mechlin Lace</span>, 18th century.) Heathcoat’s
invention, however, dealt a fatal blow to
the trade of the net-makers, and since then
Honiton lace is usually made by uniting the
sprigs on a pillow, or joining them with a needle
by various stitches, as shown in the engraving.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Honour</strong>, Legion of. Instituted 3rd June,
1802, by Napoleon I. as first consul.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Hoodman-blind.</strong> Old English for <span class='sc'>Blindman’s
Buff</span> (q.v.).</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Hoods</strong> (A.S. <em>Hod</em>) were probably introduced
by the Normans. They are constantly represented,
with great variation of fashion, in illustrations
of the 11th to 18th century, as a part of
the costume of both sexes. They were finally
displaced by caps and bonnets in the reign of
George II. (See <span class='sc'>Chaperon</span>, <span class='sc'>Cowl</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Hoops</strong>, in ladies’ dress, were introduced in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, displacing the
<span class='fss'>FARTHINGALE</span>; and were finally abandoned in
that of George III.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang"><strong>Hop-harlot</strong></span>, O. E. A very coarse coverlet

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Horatia Pila</strong></span>, R. A pillar erected at the
west extremity of the Roman forum to receive
the trophy of the spoils of the three Curiatii
brought back by Horatius.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Horns.</strong> A portion of a lady’s head-dress,
mentioned in the 13th century. They appear to
have been formed by the foldings of the <em>gorget</em> or
<em>wimple</em>, and a disposition of the hair on each side
of the head into the form of rams’ horns. For
the horned head-dress of the 15th century, see
the illustration to <span class='sc'>Coronet</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Horologium.</strong> (1) <em>Sundials</em> preceded all
other instruments for the measurement of time.
The <em>gnomon</em> or <em>stocheion</em> of the <span class='sc'>Greeks</span> was a
perpendicular staff or pillar, the shadow of
which fell upon a properly marked ground; the
<em>polos</em> or <em>heliotropion</em> consisted of a perpendicular
staff, in a basin in which the twelve parts of the
day were marked by lines. (2) The <em>clepsydra</em>
was a hollow globe, with a short neck, and holes
in the bottom; it measured time by the escape
of water, and was at first used like an hour-glass
to regulate the length of speeches in the
Athenian courts. The escape of water was
stopped by inserting a stopper in the mouth,
when the speaker was interrupted. Smaller
<em>clepsydrata</em> made of glass and marked with the
hours were used in families. A precisely similar
history applies to the <em>horologia</em> of <span class='sc'>Rome</span>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Horreum</strong> (dimin. <em>horreolum</em>), R. (1) Literally,
a place in which ripe fruits were kept; a

was the public granary. (2) Any storehouse
or depôt; <em>horrea subterranea</em>, cellars. (3)
It was applied to places in which <em>works of art</em>
were kept, and Seneca calls his library a <em>horreum</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Horse.</strong> In Christian art, the emblem of
courage and generosity; attribute of St. Martin,
St. Maurice, St. George, and others. The
Chinese have a <em>sacred horse</em>, which is affirmed to

Fou-hi, bearing instruction in eight diagrams
of the characters proper to express certain abstract
ideas.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Horse-shoe</strong>, Arch. A form of the stilted
arch elevated beyond half the diameter of the
curve on which it is described. (See <span class='sc'>Arch</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Hortus</strong> (dimin. <em>hortulus</em>), R. A pleasure-garden,
park, and thence a kitchen garden;
<em>horti pensiles</em> were hanging gardens. The most
striking features of a Roman garden were lines
of large trees planted in regular order; alleys or
walks (<em>ambulationes</em>) formed by closely clipped
hedges of box, yew, cypress, and other ever
greens; beds of acanthus, rows of fruit-trees
especially of vines, with statues, pyramids,
fountains, and summer-houses (<em>diætæ</em>). The
Romans were fond of the art of cutting and
twisting trees, especially box, into figures of
animals, ships, &amp;c. (<em>ars topiaria</em>). The principal
garden-flowers seem to have been violets
and roses, and they had also the crocus, narcissus,
lily, gladiolus, iris, poppy, amaranth, and
others. Conservatories and hot-houses are
frequently mentioned by Martial. An ornamental
garden was also called <em>viridarium</em>, and
the gardener <em>topiarius</em> or <em>viridarius</em>. The common
name for a gardener is <em>villicus</em> or <em>cultor
hortorum</em>. (Consult <em>Smith’s Dict. of Ant.</em>)</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Hospitium</strong></span>, R. (<em>hospes</em>, a guest). A general
term to denote any place in which a traveller

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Hostia</strong></span>, R. (<em>hostio</em>, to strike). A victim offered
in sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Hydra</strong>, Gr. (a water-serpent). A hundred-headed
monster of Greek mythology, sprung,
like the Chimæra, from Typhon and Echidna;
he was killed by Hercules. In Heraldry the
hydra is represented with only nine heads. The
illustration (Fig. <a href='#fig_390'>390</a>) is of the device adopted

used to force the air through the pipes. It is
represented on a coin of Nero in the British
Museum. Only ten pipes are given to it, and
there is no indication of any key-board. It had
eight stops, and consequently eight rows of
pipes; these were partly of bronze, and partly
of reed. It continued in use so late as the 9th

<p class='c006'><strong>Ich Dien.</strong> I serve. The popular belief that
Edward the Black Prince adopted this motto
and the “Prince of Wales’s feathers,” at the
battle of Cressy, from the blind King of Bohemia,
is not sustained by investigation. It was
at the battle of Poitiers that he first adopted
this crest, joining to the family badge the old
English word <em>Ic den</em> (Theyn), “I serve,” in
accordance with the words of the Apostle,
“The heir, while he is a child, differeth nothing
from a servant.” (<em>Mrs. Palliser</em>; <em>Historic Devices</em>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Ichnography.</strong> The art of making maps or
plans.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Iconic</strong> (sc. <em>statues</em>), Gr. and R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰκονικὰ</span>, i. e.)
Portrait-statues; especially statues raised in
honour of athletes who had been victorious in
the contests.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Iconoclasts</strong>, Chr. Image-breakers. The
name originated in the 8th or 9th century in
the Eastern Empire, from which finally Theophilus
banished all the painters and statuaries
in 832. It has been since generally applied to
those who, at various outbreaks of fanaticism,
have destroyed ecclesiastical objects of art, and
is especially applicable to the disciples of Savonarola
in 1497, and to the Puritans of Scotland
and England during the civil wars.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Iconography</strong> (i. e. image-description). The
science that deals with statues and images,
bas-reliefs, busts, medals, &amp;c. Thus we have
an Egyptian, Greek, Roman, mediæval iconography,
&amp;c. The best work on this science is
“Christian Iconography; or the History of
Christian Art in the Middle Ages,” by M. Didron.
The second volume contains a manual on
the subject by a painter of the 12th century.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Iconostasis</strong>, Chr. The screen of the chancel
in ancient churches, so called because it was
there that images (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰκόνες</span>) were displayed for
the adoration of the faithful.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Ideal</strong> and <strong>Real.</strong> “Any work of art which
represents, not a material object, but the mental
conception of a material object, is in the primary
sense of the word <em>ideal</em>; that is to say, it
represents an <em>idea</em>, not a <em>thing</em>. Any work of
art which represents or realizes a material object
is, in the primary sense of the term, <em>un-ideal</em>.”
(<em>Modern Painters</em>, vol. ii. chap. 13.) In a
practical sense an <em>ideal</em> picture or statue (e. g.
the Medici Venus) is not the portrait of an
individual model, but the putting together of
selected parts from several models. Raphael
said, “To paint a beautiful woman I must see
several, and I have also recourse to a certain
<em>ideal</em> in my mind;” and Guido said, “The
beautiful and pure <em>idea</em> must be in the mind, and
then it is no matter what the model is.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Ides</strong>, <strong>Idus</strong></span>, R. One of the monthly divisions
in the Roman year; it fell on the 15th in
months of thirty-one days, excepting January,
August, and December; in months with only
twenty-nine or thirty days, the <em>ides</em> fell on
the 13th. The <em>kalends</em> are the first of every
month; the <em>nones</em> are the 7th of March, May,
July, and October, and the 5th of all the other
months; and the ides always fall eight days
later than the nones; and the days are reckoned
backwards: thus the 13th of January is the ides
of January, and the 14th of January the 19th day
<em>ante diem</em> (or before) the February kalends.
The morrow of the ides was looked upon as an
unlucky day (<em>nefas</em>).</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Illapa</strong>, Peruv. One of the divisions of the
temple of the Sun (<cite>Inti</cite>) among the ancient
Peruvians, so called because it was dedicated to
the thunder (<cite>Illapa</cite>). (See <span class='sc'>Inti</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Illumination.</strong> This art originated simply in
the application of <em>minium</em> (or red lead) as a
colour or ink, to decorate a portion of a piece of
writing, the general text of which was in black
ink. The term was retained long after the
original red lead was superseded by the more
brilliant <em>cinnabar</em>, or vermilion. Ornaments of
all kinds were gradually added, and the term includes
the practice of every kind of ornamental
or ornamented writing. From the 3rd century
Greek and Roman specimens exist of golden
lettering upon purple or rose-coloured vellum,
and the art prevailed wherever monasteries were
founded. Anglo-Saxon and Irish MSS. of the
6th and 7th centuries exhibit a marvellous perfection,
characterized by wonderfully minute interlacements
of the patterns. Nearly all the best
specimens of illumination were destroyed on the
dissolution of monasteries. (Consult “<em>The
Art of Illuminating</em>,” <em>by W. R. Timms</em>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Indian Art.</strong> The study of the forms and
principles of Indian Art is indispensable to an
appreciation of the true principles of ornamental
design in general. The excellence of Indian
manufactures is due to the system of Guilds
rigidly adhered to for ages, which has resulted
in the production of a race of hereditary craftsmen
unequalled for their skill and taste in
execution and design. Their pottery is distinguished
above all others for purity and
simplicity of form, obvious fitness to purpose,
and individual freedom of design. Its origin
antedates the Institutes of Manu, and is lost in
antiquity. Indian gold and metal work is supposed
by Dr. Birdwood to owe its origin to Greek
influence, but has acquired in its development a
purely Oriental character. The Hindoos exhibit
the greatest skill in the Oriental arts of damascening
and enamelling, as well as in lacquer work
and wood and ivory carving. All their designs are
deeply symbolical, and closely interwoven with
the primitive religious impulses of humanity.
India was probably the first country in which
the art of weaving was brought to perfection,
and the fame of its cloudy gauzes and its gold
and silver brocades is more ancient than the
Code of Manu. The art is repeatedly mentioned
in the Vedas. The purity of Indian Art is
endangered in modern days by the introduction
of machine-made goods and European design.

Art</em>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Ionic</strong>, Arch. One of the orders of Grecian
architecture, distinguished principally by the
ornaments of its <span class='sc'>Capital</span>, which are spiral and
are called <span class='sc'>Volutes</span>, four in number. The Ionic
<span class='sc'>Shaft</span> is about nine diameters high, including
the <span class='sc'>Base</span> (which is half a diameter) and the
<span class='sc'>Capital</span>, to the bottom of the volute. The
<span class='sc'>Pedestal</span> is a little taller and more ornamented
than the Doric. The <span class='sc'>Bases</span> used are very
various. The Attic base is very often used,
and, with an <em>astragal</em> added above the upper
<em>torus</em>, makes a beautiful and appropriate base
for the Ionic. The <span class='sc'>Cornices</span> are (1) plain
Grecian, or (2) the <em>dentil</em> cornice, or (3) the
<em>modillon</em> cornice. The Ionic shaft may be
fluted in twenty-four semicircular flutes with
fillets between them. The best Ionic example
was the temple on the Ilissus at Athens. The
temple of Fortuna Virilis at Rome is an inferior
specimen. (See also Figs. 69, 184.)</p>

transparent, deep-toned pigment, extremely
valuable in oil and water-colour painting.
The <em>bone black</em> (commonly sold as <em>ivory

<p class='c007'><strong>Ivory Carving.</strong> This art, in considerable
perfection, was known to prehistoric
man at the period of the so called stone
age. Egyptian and Assyrian specimens of
the art are of a
date at least as
early as that of
Moses. From the
year 1000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
down to the Christian
era, there
was a constant
succession of
artists in ivory in
the western
Asiatic countries,
in Egypt, in
Greece, and in
Italy. From the time
of Augustus, ivory
carving shared in
the general decline
of art. Increasing in
number as they come
nearer to the Middle
Ages, we can refer to
carved ivories of every
century, preserved in
museums in England
and abroad. The most
important ivories up to
the 7th century are the
consular <em>diptychs</em>, originally
a favourite form
of presents from newly-appointed
consuls to
eminent persons; subsequently
adapted to
Christian uses, or as wedding presents, &amp;c. In
the Middle Ages, from the 8th to the 16th century,
the use of ivory was adopted for general
purposes. The favourite subjects of the carvings
are those drawn from the romances of the
Middle Ages—especially the romance of the
Rose—and in the 15th century, scenes of
domestic life, illustrating the dress, armour,
and manners and customs of the day. Combs
of every date, from the Roman and Anglo-Saxon
period, and earlier, are found in British
graves. In short, from the time when the first
prehistoric carvings of antediluvian animals
were made to the present, every age of human
civilization appears to be more or less fully
illustrated in carvings upon ivory and bone.
(See also <span class='sc'>Chessmen</span>.) The earliest material
was found in the tusks of the mammoth: from
Iceland we have beautiful carvings of the 7th
century in the teeth of the walrus. Fossil tusks
of the mammoth are found in great quantities
in Siberia, and are almost the only material of
the ivory-turner’s work in Russia. African and
Asiatic elephant ivory are the best, and differ,
the former, when newly cut, being of a mellow,
warm, transparent tint. Asiatic ivory tends to
become yellow by exposure. A fine specimen
of carving in ivory is given in Fig. <a href='#fig_403'>403</a> from
a <span class='sc'>Mirror-case</span> of the 15th century. (See
also Fig. <a href='#fig_185'>185</a>, and illustrations to <span class='sc'>Pyx</span>, <span class='sc'>Triptych</span>,

<p class='c007'><strong>Joinery</strong> (in Latin, <em>intestinum opus</em>) has to deal

The most celebrated work on the
subject is <em>Nicholson’s Carpenter’s Guide, and
Carpenters and Joiner’s Assistant</em>, published in
1792. The <em>modern art</em> of joinery properly dates
from the introduction of the geometrical staircase,
or stair supported by the wall only, the first
English example of which is said to have been
erected by Sir Christopher Wren in St. Paul’s.

<p class='c007'><strong>Lace</strong> was originally of a heavy texture, more
like embroidery. It was of two kinds, <em>lacis</em>, or
“darned netting,” and “<em>cutwork</em>.” <em>Lacis</em>,
often worked in coloured silks and gold thread,
was also called “opus araneum” or “spider-work.”
In “<em>cutwork</em>,” a net of threads was
laid on to cloth, and the cloth sewn to it in
parts, and the other parts cut away; or, by
another method, the threads were arranged on
a frame, all radiating from a common centre,
and then worked into patterns. This was the
old convent lace of Italy, called “<em>Greek lace</em>.”
<em>Point laces</em> are lace made with a needle on a
parchment pattern. The principal are the
ancient laces of Italy, Spain, and Portugal; and
the modern <em>point d’Alençon</em> of France. <em>Pillow
laces</em> are made by the weaving, twisting, and
plaiting of the threads with bobbins on a
<em>cushion</em>; such are Mechlin, Lille, Valenciennes,
Honiton, Buckingham, and many manufactories
in France. <em>Brussels lace</em> is both <em>point</em> and
<em>pillow</em>. The thread is scarcely visible for fineness,
and costs 240<em>l.</em> per pound. This lace is
called in France <em>point d’Angleterre</em>, or <em>English
point</em>. (Fig. <a href='#fig_414'>414</a>.)</p>

up to the middle of the 16th century represented
such devices on the hems of the garments
of great personages in their paintings.</p>

papyrus plant). A book.—Parchment (<em>membrana</em>)
was invented by Eumenes, king of Pergamos;
hence its name of <em>pergamentum</em>. The paper
(<em>charta</em>) or parchment was only written upon on one
side; the other side was stained yellow. Writings
were frequently washed off, and the parchment
used again was called <em>palimpsestus</em>. The
sheets forming a book were joined together and
rolled round a staff, and then called a <em>volume</em>
(<em>volumen</em>). The stick was usually ornamented
with balls or bosses, ornamented or painted,
called <em>umbilici</em>. The ends of the roll, carefully
cut, polished with pumice-stone, and coloured
black, were called <em>geminæ frontes</em>. The reader
held the staff in his left hand to unroll the sheet
(<em>evolvere librum</em>), as he proceeded, with his right.
The roll, if valuable, was kept in a parchment
case, which was stained with a purple colour, or
yellow. The title of the book (<em>titulus</em> or <em>index</em>)

with a light red colour (coccum or minium);

<p class='c007'><strong>Lithography</strong>, or drawing on stone, was
invented by Aloys Senefelder of Munich
in 1796. Drawings are made on a polished
surface of calcareous stone, with ink and
chalk of a soapy nature. The <em>lithographic
ink</em> is made of tallow-soap, pure white wax,
lamp-black, and a small quantity of tallow, all
boiled together, and, when cool, dissolved in
distilled water; the ingredients for the <em>lithographic
chalk</em> are the same, with a small quantity
of potash added during the boiling. After the
drawing on the stone is perfectly dry, a very
weak solution of sulphuric acid is poured over
it, which takes up the alkali from the ink or
chalk, and leaves an insoluble substance behind
it, while it lowers in a slight degree the surface
of the stone not drawn upon, and prepares it for
the free absorption of water. Weak gum-water
is next applied to close the pores of the stone,
and to keep it moist. The stone is then washed
with water, and the printing-ink applied in the
ordinary way. It then passes through the press,
the washing with water and daubing with ink
being repeated after every impression. As many
as 70,000 copies have in this way been taken
from one stone, the last being nearly as good as
the first. Copper-plate and steel engravings can
be transferred to stone. (See the article “Lithography”
in the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em>,

<p>Fig. 433. Heraldic Decoration at Versailles—Louis Quatorze.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Louis Quatorze</strong>, Arch. A style of ornament
developed towards the close of the 17th century
(1643–1715). It is described as “essentially
an <em>ornamental</em> style, its chief aim being effect by
a brilliant play of light and shade; colour, or
mere beauty of form in detail, having no part in
it. This style arose in Italy, and the Chiesa
del Gesù at Rome is mentioned as its type or
model. The great medium of the Louis
Quatorze was gilt stucco-work, which, for a
while, seems to have almost wholly superseded
decorative painting; and this absence of colour
in the principal decorations of the period seems
to have led to its more striking characteristic,—infinite
play of light and shade.” (<em>Wornum</em>,
<em>Analysis of Ornament</em>.) In this style symmetry
was first systematically avoided. In the <em>Furniture</em>
of the period the characteristic details are
the scroll and shell. The classical ornaments
and all the elements of the <em>Cinque-cento</em>, from
which the Louis Quatorze proceeded, are
admitted under peculiar treatment, as accessories;
the panels are formed by chains of
scrolls, or a combination of the scroll and shell.
Versailles is the great repertory of the Louis
Quatorze (Fig. <a href='#fig_433'>433</a>), and the designs of Watteau
its finest exemplification.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Louis Quinze</strong>, Arch. This style (1715–74)
is the exaggeration of the Louis Quatorze, rejecting
all symmetry, and introducing the
elongation of the foliations of the scroll, mixed
up with a species of crimped conventional
<em>coquillage</em> or shell-work. The style found its
culmination in the bizarre absurdities of the
Rococo.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Louvre</strong>, Arch. The open turret in the roofs
of ancient halls, through which the smoke
escaped before the introduction of modern
chimneys.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Louvre-boarding</strong> or <strong>Luffer-boarding</strong>, Arch.
A series of overlapping boards sloping from
the top downwards, and from within outwards,
and fixed in a framework of timber. They
are placed in the apertures of towers and
belfries for the sake of ventilating the timbers,
and are sloped to prevent rain and snow from
penetrating within, and to direct the sound of
the bells downwards. Sometimes the wooden
boardings are covered with lead, slate, or
zinc, in order to preserve them.</p>

Wrestling. In the Homeric

<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 720 (the 15th Olympiad)
this was discarded. The
Cretans and Lacedæmonians,
and afterwards the Greeks,
anointed the body with oil, and then strewed it
over with sand or dust. The Lucta or Palé
differed from the <em>Pancratium</em>. In the latter,
boxing and wrestling were combined, and the
contest continued until one party was killed, or
unable to continue. In wrestling, on the other
hand, the victory was awarded to the man who
first threw the other three times. The most
famous wrestler of antiquity was Milo of Crotona,

theatrical representations. <em>Ludi stati</em>, like the
<em>Feriæ statæ</em>, were those held regularly on certain
days marked in the calendar. <em>Ludi imperativi</em>, on
the other hand, were held by special appointment,
and <em>votivi</em> in fulfilment of vows. The

<p class='c007'><strong>Lute</strong> (Arabic, <em>el oud</em>). A stringed instrument
of great antiquity, first mentioned in Persia in
682 <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> Before the 10th century the lute had
only four strings, or four pairs producing four
tones, each tone having two strings tuned in
unison. About the 10th century a string for a
fifth tone was added. The strings were made of
silk neatly twisted. The neck of the instrument
was provided with frets of string, regulated
according to the system of seventeen intervals to
an octave. The Chinese god of music is represented
playing on a lute with four strings. The
lute was very popular in England in Elizabeth’s
time. Originally it had eight catgut strings, arranged
in four pairs, each pair being in unison.
The number of strings varied from time to

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Lyra</strong></span>, Gr. and R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λύρα</span>). A lyre; a
stringed instrument which assumed various
forms. On Assyrian monuments the lyre occurs in
three different forms, and is held horizontally
in playing. Its front bar was generally either
oblique or slightly curved. It was played with
a <em>plectrum</em> or with the fingers. The <span class='sc'>Hebrew</span>
lyre is represented on coins of Judas Maccabæus.
Some have three strings, others five, and others
six. The two sides of the frames appear to have
been made of horns of animals. The Hebrew
square-shaped lyre is probably the <span class='sc'>Psalterion</span>,
the <span class='sc'>Kinnor</span>, a lyre of triangular shape, the
instrument of King David, is named in the
Bible as the oldest stringed instrument, the invention
of Jubal. The Rabbis record that King
David used to suspend his over his pillow at
night. On Egyptian monuments, at Beni
Hassan, a Hebrew lyre is represented, probably
of the date of Joseph, 1700 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> The <span class='sc'>Greeks</span>
had lyres of many kinds, distinguished by different
names; <span class='sc'>Lyra</span>, a generic term, and also the
lyre oval at the base, to be held in the lap;
<span class='sc'>Kithara</span>, with a square base, to be held
against the breast; <span class='sc'>Chelys</span>, a small lyre with
body made of tortoise-shell; <span class='sc'>Phormix</span>, a large
lyre, &amp;c. Some lyres have a bridge, others have
none; the largest were probably held on or
between the knees, or were tied by a band to
the left arm. The strings of catgut or sinew
were twanged with a <em>plektron</em> or short stem of
ivory or metal, pointed at both ends. The lyre
was the most favourite instrument of the
<span class='sc'>Romans</span>, under various names. The <span class='sc'>Cornu</span>
had a frame ending at the top in two long horns;
the <span class='sc'>Barbitos</span> was a lyre with a large body;
the <span class='sc'>Psalterium</span> was of an oblong square shape,
&amp;c. The lyre is represented in early <span class='sc'>Christian</span>
monuments of the 4th century. In one of them
the Saviour is represented as Apollo touching
the lyre. <span class='sc'>Anglo-Saxon MSS.</span> of the 9th century
also represent the lyre. A <span class='sc'>German</span> fiddle
of the 9th century, with only one string, is called
<em>lyra</em> in the MS. In Christian symbolism the
lyre represented “the attractive power of the
Lord.” (See <span class='sc'>Mese</span>.)</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Maiolica</strong> or <strong>Majolica</strong>. The Italian name for
the glazed earthenware introduced by Moorish
potters from the island of Majorca. Originally

but from the 16th century they were generally
applied to the <em>glazed earthenware</em> of Italy. A
coarser lead-glazed lustred ware was known as
mezza-majolica. The distinguishing characteristics
of the Majolica ware are “coarseness of
ware, intricacy of pattern, and occasionally prismatic
glaze.” It is also named <span class='sc'>Faience</span>, from
the <em>botega</em> at <span class='sc'>Faenza</span>, and, when decorated with
subjects after designs of Raphael, “Raffaelle-ware.” <span class='sc'>Fayence</span>, <em>terraglia</em>, as distinct from
<span class='sc'>Porcelain</span>, is formed of potter’s clay (hence its
English name Pottery) mixed with marl and
sand, and is <em>soft</em> or <em>hard</em> according to the nature
of the composition, and the degree of heat under
which it is fired in the kiln. English <em>earthenware</em>
is soft, while <em>stone-ware</em>, <em>Queen’s ware</em>, &amp;c.,
are hard. Soft wares are either unglazed, or
<em>lustrous</em>, or <em>glazed</em>, or enamelled. The Italian
lustrous ware is properly, and the glazed ware

<p>Fig. 443. Shaft ornamented with Marquetry.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Marquetry.</strong> Inlaid-work
of ornamental woods and
stones of various colours
put together and mixed with
metals. The art has existed
from the earliest ages; but
no nation has brought it
to a higher degree of perfection
than the Italians of
the 15th century. The
Florentines especially have
produced work of this kind
which is unapproached; the
Medici chapel at Florence
may be particularly instanced.
Figs. 443 and 444
represent specimens of antique
work. The Venetian
marquetry, derived from
Persia and India, is a fine
inlay of ivory, metal, and
woods, stained to vary the
colour. This work is in
geometric patterns only. In
France, in the early marquetry designs, picturesque
landscapes, broken architecture, and figures are
represented. Colours are occasionally stained
on the wood. Ivory and ebony are the favourite
materials. In England, it is an art imported
from Holland in the reign of William and
Mary. The older designs on Dutch marquetry
represent tulips and other flowers, foliage, birds,
&amp;c., all in gay colours, generally the self colours
of the wood used. Sometimes the eyes and
other salient points are in ivory and mother-of-pearl.

<p class='c007'><strong>Mechlin Lace</strong> is fine, transparent, and effective.
It is made in one piece on the pillow;
its distinguishing feature is the flat thread which
forms the flowers, and gives to the lace the
character of embroidery. In 1699—when
Charles II.’s prohibition to the introduction of
Flanders lace was removed—Mechlin lace
became the fashion in England, and continued
so during the succeeding century. In the 17th
century the Beguinage nuns were celebrated for
their lace-making, and they supported their
house by their work. Previous to 1665 the
name of Mechlin was given to all pillow lace,
and much of it was made like our modern
insertion. The engraving shows a specimen
of old Mechlin lace formerly in great favour as
head-dresses and other trimmings.</p>

work were joined together into a long scroll,
which was folded round a staff, and then called
<em>volumen</em>; usually there were ornamental balls
or bosses, projecting from the ends of the staff,
called <em>umbilici</em> or <em>cornua</em>. The ends of the roll

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Meta</strong></span>, R. (<em>metior</em>, to measure). Any object
with a circular base and of conical shape; in
a circus the term <em>meta</em>, or rather <em>metæ</em> (for there
were two sets of goals), was applied to a set of
three cones placed together upon a pedestal,
as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_456'>456</a>, to mark the turning-points
of the race-course. In a mill for grinding corn
the name of <em>meta</em> was

<p class='c007'><strong>Metallurgy.</strong> It was at a comparatively late
period of human civilization that the art of
working in iron was brought to perfection. The
ancient Egyptians, probably aware of its resources,
had a superstitious objection to its use;
but they hardened bronze to a degree unknown
to later ages, and their bronze statuary of the
most ancient period is worthy of any age. The
bronze-work of Britain and Ireland is as ancient
as any; and, in beauty of form and perfection of
casting, rivals the best modern work. Of the
work in Greece we are told that Athens alone
contained 3000 bronze statues in the year 130 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>,
and vast treasures of metallurgy have been discovered
in Herculaneum and Pompeii. In
mediæval times Ireland was famous for metallurgy,
and of its admirable copper-works of the
11th century many splendid relics remain,
especially the so called Bell of St. Patrick.
Oriental bronzes, of characteristic design, are
plentiful from all ages; especially beautiful
and perfect in execution are those of China and
Japan. The best period of workmanship in
<em>Iron</em> is the Middle Ages; gates and hinges, keys,
and especially weapons and defensive armour being
the chief objects produced. (Consult <em>Pugin</em>, <em>Digby
Wyatt</em>.) (See also <span class='sc'>Bronze</span>, <span class='sc'>Copper</span>, <span class='sc'>Damascening</span>,

<p class='c007'><strong>Moorish Architecture</strong>, or Arabian or Mohammedan
architecture, arose at the beginning
of the 7th century in the East, and in Spain,

earliest mosques were built by Christian architects.
The horse-shoe arch is a very early
characteristic of their style, and the pointed arch
appears at Cairo and elsewhere three centuries
earlier than in Europe. The most perfect
specimen of the luxury of decoration of which
this style is capable is found in the Alhambra.

<p class='c007'><strong>Necklaces.</strong> An ornament common to all ages
and nations. The ancient <span class='sc'>Egyptians</span> of both
sexes wore them of gold or beads, generally with
a large drop or figure in the centre, and strung
of the various religious emblems; amethysts,
pearls, gold or cornelian bottles, imitations of
fish, shell, and leaves; finally, an infinite variety
of devices. (See <em>Wilkinson’s Ancient Egyptians</em>,
ii. 343.) An illustration of a common form of
<span class='sc'>Greek</span> necklaces is given under <em>Crotalium</em>. The
<span class='sc'>British</span> women of the earliest ages wore necklaces
of jet, ivory, and amber, beads, shells,
&amp;c., besides gold links hooked together. (See
also <span class='sc'>Monile</span>, <span class='sc'>Torque</span>.) The Anglo-Norman
ladies do not appear to have worn necklaces,
and no mediæval examples are found earlier than
the 15th century. (See Figs. 303, 304, 483.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Neck-mouldings</strong>, Arch. The mouldings at
the bottom of the capital, in Gothic architecture.</p>

prophecy). Calling up the spirits of the dead
for divination; hence generally applied to conjuring.
Necromancy was practised in two ways:
by inspection of the entrails, and by invoking
the dead.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Necropolis</strong>, Gr. A city of the dead; a
cemetery.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Nectar</strong>, Gr. The drink of the gods.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Necysia</strong>, Gr. Offerings of garlands of flowers
and other objects made at the tombs of deceased
relatives on the anniversary of the day of death,

<p class='c007'><strong>Needfire</strong>, or Fire of St. John Baptist
(Old Germ. <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nodfyr, Niedfyr</span></i>). A superstitious
practice of the ancients, derived from
a pagan source, of celebrating the birthday
of St. John Baptist at the midsummer solstice
(St. John’s Eve) by lighting fires, carrying about
firebrands, or rolling a burning wheel. The
practice is one of many examples of the caution
with which the evangelizing ecclesiastics of the
Middle Ages refrained from abruptly disturbing
the deeply-rooted superstitions of the ancient
Germans. [Consult <em>Grimm’s German Mythology</em>;

<p class='c007'><strong>Nimbus</strong> (Lat. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nimbus</span></i>, a bright or black
cloud). In Christian art, a disc or plate, commonly
golden, sometimes red, blue, or green,
or banded like a rainbow, placed vertically behind
the heads of persons of special dignity or
sanctity as a symbol of honour. After the
8th century living persons were, in Italy, distinguished
by a square nimbus, which sometimes
assumed the form of a scroll partly unrolled.
The nimbus is of heathen origin. Virgil describes
Juno as “nimbo succincta.” The heads of
the statues of the gods, and the Roman emperors,
after they began to claim divine honours, were
decorated with a crown of rays. On medals of
the Christian emperors also the nimbus is found,
e.g. Constantine. In illuminated MSS. it is
found on Pharaoh, Ahab, and other kings. It
is a familiar symbol of dignity or power in the
East, but does not appear as a Christian emblem
before the 6th century. [See the article <span class='sc'>Nimbus</span>

begins to manifest its power. There, in a graceful
chequer-work, the fleur-de-lis of France
heightens at intervals a semé of trefoils and
rosettes; scrolls of notched leaves combine in
graceful borders; circles divided crossways
receive in their sections stars and heraldic
suns; here are armour-clad warriors, mounted
upon horses richly caparisoned, &amp;c.—all that

details are elaborate and richly carved.
The whole is often painted of a rich brown

<p class='c007'><strong>Palissy Ware.</strong> The pieces to which Palissy
owes his reputation, in the first place, are the
so called “rustic pottery” (<em>rustiques figulines</em>),
“dishes or vases where upon a rough ground

are running, frogs jumping, snakes crawling
or sleeping, or more still, in a streamlet of
water wriggling eels, pointed-nosed pikes, trout

our fresh-water fishes are swimming.” When
afterwards he worked in the capital, he did not
give up his rustic compositions, but mixed them
with the human figure. “There is an identity of
style in all his figures and compositions; such
as the Diana, Plenty, &amp;c., framed round with

I. II. III. The colours of these rare specimens
vary. The kinds most highly prized have
a brownish-yellow ground, over which is thrown

<p class='c007'><strong>Potichomanie.</strong> A process of ornamenting

<p class='c007'><strong>Potter’s Clay</strong>, found in Dorsetshire and
Devonshire, is used for modelling and for
pottery; mixed with linseed oil, it is used as a
<em>ground</em> in painting.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Pottery</strong> (<strong>Fayence</strong>, <strong>Terraglia</strong>), as distinct from
porcelain, is formed of potter’s clay mixed with
marl of argillaceous and calcareous nature, and
sand, variously proportioned, and may be classed
under two divisions: <em>Soft</em> (Fayence à pâte
tendre), and <em>Hard</em> (Fayence à pâte dure), according
to the nature of the composition or the
degree of heat under which it has been fired in
the kiln. What is known generally in England
as <em>earthenware</em> is soft, while <em>stone-ware</em>, <em>Queen’s ware</em>,
&amp;c., are hard. The characteristics of the
soft wares are a paste or body which may be
scratched with a knife or file, and fusibility
generally at the heat of a porcelain furnace.
These soft wares may be again divided into
four subdivisions: <em>unglazed</em>, <em>lustrous</em>, <em>glazed</em>, or
<em>enamelled</em>. Among the three first of these subdivisions
may be arranged almost all the ancient
pottery of Egypt, Greece, Etruria, and Rome;
as also the larger portion of that in general use
among all nations during mediæval and modern
times. The <em>glazed wares</em> may be again divided
into <em>silicious</em> or <em>glass-glazed wares</em>, and <em>plumbeous</em>
or <em>lead-glazed</em>. In these subdivisions the
foundation is in all cases the same. The mixed
clay or “paste” or “body” is formed by the
hand or on the wheel, or impressed into moulds;
then slowly dried and baked in a furnace or
stove, after which, on cooling, it is in a state to
receive the glaze. This is prepared by fusing
sand or other silicious material with potash or
soda to form a translucent glass, the composition
of the glaze upon vitreous or <em>glass-glazed</em> wares.
The addition of oxide of lead constitutes the
glaze of <em>plumbeous</em> wares; and the further addition
of the oxide of tin produces an enamel of
an opaque white of great purity, which is the
characteristic glazing of <em>stanniferous</em> or <em>tin-glazed
wares</em>. Most of the principal seats of the
manufacture of pottery, and a description of
the objects manufactured, and methods used in
the manufacture, will be found mentioned under
their respective headings.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Reticella</strong> (Lat. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">reticulus</span></i>, a little net). This
was the first known needle-made lace, produced
in all lace-making countries under different
names. (See <span class='sc'>Greek Lace</span>.) It was made in
several ways: the first consisted in arranging a
network of threads on a small frame, crossing
and interlacing them in various complicated
patterns. Beneath this network was gummed a
piece of fine cloth, open like canvas, called quintain
(from the town in Brittany where it was
made). Then with a needle the network was
sewn to the quintain by edging round those
parts of the pattern which were to remain thick,
then cutting away the superfluous cloth:
hence the name of cutwork in England. A
more simple mode was to make the pattern detached
without any linen; the threads radiating
at equal distances from one common centre
served as a framework to others, which were
united to them in geometric forms worked over
with button-hole stitch (or <em>point noué</em>). The
engraving shows a fine specimen of reticella
from Venice, 1493. (See also <span class='sc'>Milan Reticella</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Rings.</strong> The symbolic use of signet-rings is
mentioned in many passages of the Holy Scriptures,
especially as a transfer of authority; as
Pharaoh to Joseph (Gen. xli. 42),
Ahasuerus to Haman, &amp;c. A large
collection of Egyptian signet-rings
is in the British Museum, many
being much too large to be worn on
the hand. <span class='sc'>Egyptian</span> rings were of
ivory, porcelain, or stone, but generally
of gold. The <span class='sc'>Etruscans</span>
and <span class='sc'>Sabines</span> wore rings at the
foundation of Rome, 753 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, those
of the former being remarkable for
beauty and intrinsic value. The
<span class='sc'>Lacedæmonians</span> wore iron rings.
The <span class='sc'>Romans</span> also under the Republic
were proud of wearing an
iron ring; under the Empire the
privilege of wearing a ring raised the wearer to
the equestrian order. <span class='sc'>Greek</span> and <span class='sc'>Roman</span> rings
were, generally speaking, massive and simple, and
of obvious value
in metal and
stone, until in
the degenerate
times of the
Empire luxury
spread, and the
lower classes began
to disfigure
themselves with
cheap jewellery.
Solid rings were
carved out of
rock-crystal in
Christian times;
and others were
made of stone,
chiefly of calcedony.
Rings
of amber, glass,
earthenware, and
other materials
were exhumed at
Pompeii. The
<span class='sc'>Britons</span> and <span class='sc'>Saxons</span> had beautiful jewellery.
The former wore the ring on the middle
finger; the Anglo-Saxons on the third finger of
the right hand, which was thence poetically
called the “golden finger.” A beautiful specimen
of enamelled art is the gold ring of Ethelwulf,
king of Wessex (the father of Alfred the
Great), now in the medal room of the British
Museum. Among the <em>niello</em> rings of the
Saxon period is one in the British Museum inscribed
“Ahlreds owns me, Eanred engraved
me.” Plain wire rings, or plain bands of metal
merely twisted round the finger, are common
objects in Saxon tombs; but the most beautiful
specimens of this, as of other branches of the
goldsmith’s art in antiquity, are from <span class='sc'>Ireland</span>.
In <span class='sc'>Scandinavia</span> the earliest forms are spiral,
and of simple workmanship. <span class='sc'>Rings</span> were a part
of the official jewellery of kings, bishops, and
cardinals; and the <em>fisherman’s ring</em>, with a representation
of St. Peter in a boat fishing, was
the papal ring of investiture. A copious literature
on this special subject deals with the superstitions,
ceremonies, customs, and anecdotes
connected with finger-rings, as well as with their
exemplification of the history of the development
or decadence of art. A collector divides his
rings into <em>Antique</em>, <em>Mediæval</em>, and <em>Modern</em>; the
former period ending <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 800, and classified by
nationalities. The later collections are classified
as <em>Official</em>: ecclesiastical, civil, and military;
or <em>Personal</em>, viz. signet-rings, love and marriage,
mourning, &amp;c.; historical, religious (i. e. devotional,
&amp;c.), magic, and simply ornamental.
(The substance of the above is drawn from
<em>Finger-ring Lore</em>, &amp;c., by <em>W. Jones</em>, Chatto,
1877; and <em>Antique Gems</em>, by the <em>Rev. C. W.
King</em>. For the significance of rings in connexion
with the history of Christianity, see <em>Smith
and Cheetham</em>, <em>Dict. of Christ. Ant.</em> s. v.)</p>

white, others golden yellow, and others again
blue and black. One kind looks as if human
hair was thrown in and crystallized. <em>Imitations</em>
of this stone are common in Canton, made into
snuff-bottles, such as are commonly used by the
Chinese.” The <span class='sc'>Greek</span> name (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρύσταλλος</span>, ice)

the <span class='sc'>Indians</span> believe it to be the husk of which
the <em>diamond</em> is the kernel, and call it the <em>unripe

used for cooling the hands; in <span class='sc'>China</span> also it is
extensively carved; in the <span class='sc'>Middle Ages</span> it was

<p class='c007'><strong>Roman Architecture</strong> is a combination of the
<em>Etruscan</em> and the <em>Greek</em>, principally distinguished
from the latter by the circular arch, and the
<em>monopteral</em> or circular temple unknown to the
Greeks, but a favourite form with the tomb-building
ancestors of the Etruscans. The <em>orders</em>
of Roman architecture were the Doric and
Ionic, detrimentally modified; the Corinthian,
which they greatly enriched; and the Composite,
of which the upper part of the capital
was Ionic, and the remainder Corinthian. The
distinguishing feature of the Roman architecture
is, however, less in the modifications of the orders,
than in their application in <em>composite arcades</em>, or
plain arches of Etruscan design, faced by and
supporting a purely ornamental arrangement of
a long horizontal entablature on two columns.
(Consult <em>Fergusson</em>, <em>Hist. of Arch.</em>, vol. i.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Roman Doric Order of Architecture.</strong> A deteriorated

<p class='c007'><strong>Roman Sepia</strong> is <em>sepia</em> (q.v.) mixed with
red.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Romanesque.</strong> A degenerated and hybrid
style of architecture and ornament, transitional
from the classical Roman to the introduction of
the Gothic. In the architecture there is an
incongruous combination of the horizontal and
arched methods of construction; and in the
ornament a similar dissonance of natural and
conventional or fanciful objects. <em>Fairholt</em> calls
it the <em>classic rococo</em>. <em>Fergusson</em> (<em>Hist. of Arch.</em>,
vol. i. p. 352) defines the <em>Romanesque</em> as “that
modification of the classical Roman form, which
was introduced between the reigns of Constantine
and Justinian, and was avowedly an attempt
to adapt classical forms to Christian purposes.”
He says, “If <em>Romanesque</em> is to be applied to
our Norman architecture, the Parthenon ought
to be called <em>Egyptianesque</em>, and the Temple at
Ephesus <em>Assyrianesque</em>.” There seems to be
no universally-received definition of this term.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Rorarii</strong></span>, R. (<em>ros</em>, the dew). A body of light
skirmishers in the Roman army, who were
ranged in the second rank of the <em>triarii</em>, with the
<em>accensi</em> behind them in the third line. They took
their name from the light missiles which they
scattered upon the enemy, which were like the
drops of rain before a thunder shower. It was
their business to begin the attack, and retire
behind the <em>triarii</em> when pressed. Their skirmishing
was a prelude to the charge of the
heavy-armed spears (<em>hastati</em>).</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Rosary</strong>, Chr. A string or chaplet of beads

<p class='c007'><strong>Rose</strong>, Her. Represented in blazon without
leaves. The rose of England is generally drawn
like the natural flower, or with natural stem,
branches, leaves, and buds, but with heraldic
rose-flowers. (See Fig. <a href='#fig_395'>395</a>.) In Classic art,
a rose upon a tomb is an emblem of a short
life. The ancient
Romans
were passionately
fond of
roses, and cultivated
them assiduously
in their
gardens, and introduced
them
plentifully in their feasts and symposia. In
<em>mediæval</em> England roses were the favourite presents
on birthdays; and Whitsuntide was called,
from the plenty of them, Rose Easter. Sticking
a rose in the ear was the boast of an accepted
lover.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Round Towers.</strong> There are upwards of a hundred

Generally the tower is a hollow circular
column from 50 to 150 feet high, capped by a
short pointed roof of stone. The base, frequently
of cyclopean masonry, measures from
40 to 60 feet in circumference, and the form of
the whole tower is tapering towards the summit.
The single entrance door is always from 8 to 15
feet above the ground; the windows, scattered,
light the internal stories or rooms. Innumerable
and wild conjectures of the origin and purpose
of these towers have been made. The most
sober appears to be that they were the earliest
form of buildings of a monastic order, adapted
to the exigencies of a Christian settlement in the
midst of pagans and pirates. (See <em>Petrie</em>, <em>The
Round Towers of Ireland</em>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Sculpture</strong> (from <em>sculpo</em>, to carve) includes all
carved work, in wood, ivory, stone, marble,

formed in a softer material not requiring carving,
such as wax or clay. It includes <span class='sc'>Statuary</span>,
carved ornament, and <span class='sc'>Glyptics</span> or
incised gems and cameos. From the practice of
preparing the model in clay, sculpture is also
called <em>the plastic art</em>. A most remarkable incident
in the history of sculpture, is the fact that
the most ancient specimens are carved of the
hardest stones, such as basalt, granite, and porphyry;
and that this work was done at a period
antecedent to the introduction of steel tools.

<p>Fig. 611. Sheaf. Device of Alphonso d’Avalos.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Sheaf.</strong> (1) A bundle of ripe corn bound up in
the field; the device assumed by Alfonso
d’Avalos, when he was made captain-general of
the army of Charles V., with the motto implying
incessant devotion to his work,—that, as soon as
one harvest is reaped, its successor must be sown.
(2) A bunch of twenty-four arrows, enough to fill
a quiver.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Sheep.</strong> In Christian art, the twelve apostles
occur in early mosaics as twelve sheep, and our
Lord in the midst as their Shepherd.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Shekel.</strong> A Jewish coin, value about 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em></p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Shell</strong>, Chr. In Gallic as in Christian tombs
shells are of frequent occurrence; there is no
doubt that they symbolize the resurrection,
the body of man being looked upon as a shell
which he leaves behind him at death. Different
kinds of shell are met with, but that of most
frequent occurrence is the common snail-shell
(<em>helix pomatia</em>). (See <span class='sc'>Escallop</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Shell-cameos.</strong> Cameos carved on shells.
These are certain conch shells or strombs, the
substance of which consists of two distinct layers
of different colours. The black conch offers the
most decided contrast in the colours.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Shell-lac.</strong> Crude lac-resin melted into plates
or <em>shales</em>. (See <span class='sc'>Lac</span>.)</p>

church spires.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Ship.</strong> A symbol of the Church. (See <span class='sc'>Navette</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Shoes.</strong> The shoes worn by the Greeks generally
reached to the middle of the leg; the
<span class='sc'>Romans</span> had the <em>calceus</em> and the <em>solea</em> or sandal;
the former was worn with the toga on ordinary
occasions; the sandal on a journey or at a
feast; but it was considered effeminate to
appear in public with them. Black shoes were
worn by the citizens of ordinary rank (see
<span class='sc'>Atramentum</span>, <span class='sc'>Chalcanthum</span>), and white
ones (sometimes red) by the women; on ceremonial
occasions the magistrates wore red
shoes. Patricians and their children wore a
crescent shoe-buckle (see <span class='sc'>Luna</span>). Slaves went
barefooted. The Jews had shoes of leather,
wood, &amp;c., tied with thongs passed under the
soles of the feet; to “untie the latchets” of a
man’s shoes was a sign of deep subservience.
In ancient as in modern times the Oriental
peoples put off their shoes as we uncover the
head. (Consult <em>Herbert Spencer on Ceremonies</em>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Sibylline</strong> (Books), R. The Sibylline books
were a series of oracles of the destiny of the
Roman Empire; they were three in number, and
were placed by Tarquin in a vault of the temple
of Jupiter Capitolinus, and were consulted in
cases of difficulty by an order of the senate.
They perished in 670 <span class='fss'>A.U.C.</span>, when the Capitol

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Silver.</strong> The history of working in silver is
identical with that of Goldsmiths’ work in general.
(See <span class='sc'>Gold</span>.) <em>Pollen</em> remarks that though
Phidias and his contemporaries made great
statues of gold, many artists who devoted themselves
mainly and altogether to working in the
precious metals executed their best work in
silver. Silver was also largely used for the surfaces
of mirrors, which were hung on the walls
of temples. The best collection of antique silver
plate was found at Hildesheim, in Germany, in
1869, and is now in the Berlin Museum. The
silver stoup (Fig. <a href='#fig_615'>615</a>) belonging to the Corporation
of Norwich, is of the time of Elizabeth.
The illustration (Fig. <a href='#fig_614'>614</a>) of the silver dish and
ewer at St. John’s College (1670), is representative
of the change that the goldsmiths’ style
underwent about the middle of the 17th century,
after which time the light and graceful leaf work
gave way to heavier designs. (Consult <em>Pollen</em>,
<em>Gold and Silversmiths’ Work</em>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Silver, Cloth of.</strong> Josephus tells us that the

<p class='c007'><strong>Sinister</strong>, Her. The left side of a shield
(considered from the back, or wearer’s point of
view). The <em>bendlet</em> or <em>baton sinister</em> is generally
(not rigorously) regarded in modern Heraldry as
the most appropriate <em>difference</em> of illegitimacy.
(Consult <em>Boutell’s English Heraldry</em>, p. 194.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Sinopia.</strong> A fine red pigment found upon

for exhausting liquids from a vessel by the pressure
of the atmosphere. A painting at Thebes
shows that the principle of the siphon was
known to the Egyptians as early as the eighteenth
dynasty. The same name was applied
to a suction and forcing pump, which was generally
employed as a fire-engine.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Sirens</strong> (Gr. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σειρῆνες</span> [probably from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σειρὰ</span>, a
<em>chain</em>, to signify their attractive power]). These
mythical representatives of the evil side of the
seductive power of music, are represented in
art as lovely women to the waist, and fishes
or birds below. Sometimes they have wings,
which the Muses are said to have plucked (see
<span class='sc'>Muses</span>) of their feathers; as Orpheus, by opening
their minds to the unattainable higher
music, drove them to suicide in the end. In
Christian symbolism the sirens typify the three
carnal lusts. (See Fig. <a href='#fig_455'>455</a>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Sirpea.</strong> (See <span class='sc'>Scirpea</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Sispa-sastra</strong>, Hind. A Hindoo work, the

<p class='c007'><strong>Sistrum</strong>, Egyp. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σεῖστρον</span>; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σείω</span>, to shake).
A kind of rattle formed by a certain number of
metallic rods which passed through a framework
also of metal; this was attached to a short
handle ending in a head of Athor. By shaking
the instrument by the handle the metallic rods
and the movable rings suspended from them
were made to give out a sharp rattling sound.
The Egyptians made use of the sistrum in the
ceremonial worship of Isis and at funerals.
Roman coins of Hadrian present a personification
of Egypt as a female figure seated with the
sacred ibis at her feet, and a <em>sistrum</em> in her
hand. The instrument is still in use on the
Nile.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Soles of the Feet</strong>, Egyp. and Chr. On a
great number of Christian tombs there occur representations
of the soles of the feet. This
symbol has been variously explained. In our
opinion, one which has never been broached before,
it denoted that the dead were in the
power of God; for among the Egyptians, whenever
a god or powerful king was spoken of, it
was said of him that he put his enemies under
the sole of his foot. Ezekiel uses the same terms
in speaking of Jehovah. Whenever an Egyptian
went on a pilgrimage to a distant place, he
never left the country without engraving on some
stone the impression of his feet, to which he
added his name and titles. (<cite>Bosc.</cite>)</p>

Orange. When the French princes were suddenly
ordered into action, hastily tying their
cravats—in peaceful times an elaborate proceeding—they
rushed to the charge and gained the day.
In honour of this event ladies also wore their
lace neckerchiefs twisted in this careless fashion.
Steinkerques became the rage, and were worn
in England and France by men and women for
many years afterwards. The engraving represents
the Grand Dauphin of France wearing a
Steinkerque.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Tankard.</strong> (Norman Fr. Tankar.) A drinking-jug
with a cover. The name is said to be compounded
of <em>étain</em>, tin, and <em>quarte</em>, a quart measure.
The Flemish had tankards of wood, with
pegs down the sides, to measure the quantity
drunk. (See Figs. 615 and 645.) (See <span class='sc'>Pokal</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Tapestry.</strong> The introduction of <em>tapestry</em> properly
so called dates from the 12th century,
when it began to rival the more ancient embroidered
stuffs called <em>Sarrazinois carpets</em>. Tapestry
is woven on looms, i. e. on a <em>warp</em> rolled round
two cylinders, and stretched out between them
either vertically or horizontally, for the insertion
of the <em>woof</em> between and among the threads.
When woven on a vertical warp, it is called
high-warp (<em>haute-lisse</em>); when horizontal, low-warp
(<em>basse-lisse</em>). The former produces, for
many reasons, incomparably the finest work, and
is the method adopted for the Gobelins and
Savonnerie tapestries. The progress of the art
has followed, especially in Flanders, that of
painting, from which its models are derived. It
has become less popular than it was during the
present century, from the general disuse of
hangings in the decoration of houses. Perhaps
the best condensed account of this extensive
subject is the work of M. Alfred de Champeaux,
translated for the South Kensington Museum.

<p class='c007'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><strong>Templum</strong>, <strong>Temple</strong></span>, R. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέμνω</span>, to cut off). A
Greek temple was not originally intended for
worshippers, but as a shrine for the gods.
In the earliest times the Greek temples were
made of wood, and the primitive origin of
them was probably a hollow tree in which the
image was placed as in a niche. The early
Greek temples were dark and gloomy, having
no windows, but lighted through the door, or
by lamps. At a very early stage in history,
temples of great grandeur and beauty are mentioned.
All temples were built in an oblong
or round form, and were mostly adorned
with columns; they were classified accordingly
as <em>astyle</em>, without any columns; <em>in antis</em>, with
two columns in front, between the <em>antæ</em>; <em>prostyle</em>,
with four columns in front; or <em>amphiprostyle</em>,
with four columns at each end;
<em>peripteral</em>, with columns at each end and along
the sides; or <em>dipteral</em>, with two ranges of columns
all round, one within the other, &amp;c. They
were also described according to the number of
columns in the porticoes, as <em>tetrastyle</em>, <em>hexastyle</em>,
<em>decastyle</em>, &amp;c.,—this number was never uneven;
or according to the intercolumniation, as <em>pycnostyle</em>,
<em>systyle</em>, <em>eustyle</em>, <em>diastyle</em>, or <em>aræostyle</em>.
Many of the great temples consisted of
three parts: the <em>pronaos</em> or vestibule; the
<em>cella</em>, properly the <em>naos</em>; and the <em>opisthodomos</em>.</p>

a place for seeing). The construction of the
ancient <span class='sc'>Greek</span> theatre was similar to that of
modern theatres. The seats rose one behind
and above the other in concentric half-circles,
and the whole space enclosed was called <em>cavea</em>,
the pit, being in most cases a real excavation
from the rock. The central level space within
and below the circles for spectators was covered
with boards, upon which the <em>chorus</em> danced and
performed their part. This was the <span class='sc'>Orchestra</span>,
the central point of which and of the plan of the
whole building was the <span class='sc'>Thymele</span>, or altar of
Dionysus. This altar became a <em>property</em> of the
piece, doing duty as a funeral monument, an
altar, or a pulpit for the leader of the chorus or
flute-player, according to the nature of the performance
going on, in which it must be remembered
that the part assigned to the <em>chorus</em> in the
orchestra below was quite as important as any
other, and in its original intention was in fact
the centre of interest, to which the performance
on the stage was <em>accessory</em>. The whole theatre
and orchestra were open to the sky. The cavea
of the former accommodated about 50,000 spectators.
The arrangements of the stage were
elaborate and ingenious, and the art of <em>scene-painting</em>
developed at a very early period. The
<span class='sc'>Roman</span> theatre differed from the Greek principally
in the absence of an <em>orchestra</em>, that space
(the modern <em>pit</em>) being used for the seats of
senators, foreign ambassadors, &amp;c. Remains of
ancient theatres still exist in Greece, Italy, and
France. The most perfect of these are the
Colosseum at Rome, and the amphitheatre at
Nismes.</p>

Distinguished from <em>balneæ</em>. The luxurious establishments
for bathing, gymnastics, and conversation
which grew up under the Roman
Empire, on which all the resources of architecture
and decorative art were lavished. The
ruins of the <em>thermæ</em> of Titus, Caracalla, and
Diocletian are still visible. They contained,
besides the baths properly so called, “<em>exedræ</em> for

<p class='c007'><strong>Theseum.</strong> An Athenian temple built in the
5th century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, to receive the bones of Theseus.
It was richly ornamented with statuary
and sculpture. The former has been destroyed;
but some metopes and sculptured friezes in high
relief remain, of which castings exist in the
British Museum. Our illustration represents an
incident of the “Battle of the gods and the
giants,” and is remarkable for anatomical precision.
In these sculptures Greek art has entirely
emerged from the <em>archaic</em> stage, and they
were doubtless the inspiring models for Pheidias
and his contemporaries, and the forerunners of
the Parthenon sculptures. (See <span class='sc'>Elgin Marbles</span>.)</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Thesmo-phoria.</strong> Greek festivals of women
and maidens in honour of Demeter, in commemoration

The solemnities opened with processions of
women bearing on their heads the books of the
sacred laws (ascribed to Demeter). On the
second day, of fasting and mourning, the women
remained all day grouped round the statue of
Demeter in the temple, taking no other food
than cakes of sesame and honey, and in the
afternoon walked barefoot in procession behind
a waggon on which baskets with mystical symbols
were borne to the <em>thesmophorion</em>. On the third
day they commemorated the smiles of Demeter,
under the epithet of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλλιγένεια</span>.</p>

for a sick-room, consisting of the dried tops
of rosemary, sage-leaves, lavender-flowers, and
bruised cloves, steeped in acetic acid and boiling
water. It derives its name and popularity from
a story that thieves who plundered the dead
bodies during the plague with perfect security,
attributed their impunity to the use of this disinfectant.

of thistles alternating with bunches of rue
sprigs, or on a dark green ribbon across the
shoulder. The order of the <em>Ecu d’Or</em>, instituted
by Louis of Bourbon (1410), had also a <em>thistle</em> in

<p>Fig. 674. Unicorn. Device of the Orsini family.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Unicorn.</strong> In Christian art a symbol of
purity, especially of female chastity. Attribute
of St. Justina of Antioch. In Heraldry it is
famous as the sinister supporter of the Royal
Shield of England. The legend was that its
body took the form of a horse and antelope, and
it had one horn on its head. It was believed to
live solitary in the woods, and could only be
caught by a maiden. The property of detecting
poison was attributed to its horn, and Hentzner,
who visited England in 1598, says:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“We were shown at Windsor the horn of an Unicorn,
of about eight spans and a half in length, valued at above
100<em>l.</em>”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is frequently mentioned in ancient inventories:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">1391. Une manche d’or d’un essay de lincourne pour
attoucher aux viandes de Monseigneur le Dauphin.</span>”
<em>Comptes Royaux</em>, quoted by Mrs. Bury Palliser.</p>

<p class='c007'>In allusion to this property, Alviano, the
champion of the Orsini family, adopted as his
device a unicorn at a fountain surrounded by
snakes, toads, and other reptiles, and stirring up
the water with its horn before he drinks, with
the motto, “I expel poisons.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><strong>Urn.</strong> The
common urn,
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάλπις</span> of
the Greeks,
had a narrow
neck and
swelling body;
it was
used for conveying
water
from the fountain.
The funereal
cinerary
urn was
in general
quadrangular,
but there
were a large number which resembled the <em>kalpis</em>,
with the exception that they had a wider neck
and were furnished in every case with a lid.
Fig. <a href='#fig_677'>677</a> represents a funeral urn of Indian pottery,
of very ancient date. The electoral urn,
from which lots were drawn at the comitia
to decide the order of voting, was of an oval
form and had a narrow neck to prevent the
possibility of more than one number being drawn
out at a time. An urn is always introduced as an
appropriate emblem of the river-gods. The
<em>urna</em> was a measure of capacity containing
eight <em>congii</em> or half an <span class='sc'>Amphora</span>.</p>

greased on the outside. The peasants of Greece
were fond of dancing and leaping upon these
wine-skins, which it was extremely difficult to
do without frequent falls. This was a very
popular rustic game, and formed a principal
feature of the second day of the festival of
Bacchus, called by the Greeks <em>Ascolia</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀσκώλια</span>),

of the manufacture of this lace is unknown,
although it existed before the time of Louis
XIV., under whose reign it flourished and
reached its climax between 1725 and 1780.
Valenciennes lace is made entirely on the
pillow, of simple combinations, with one
kind of thread for the pattern and for the
ground. (See engraving.) No lace is so expensive
to make from the number of bobbins
required. The flax used is of the finest quality,
so fine that the lace-makers worked in underground
cellars to keep their work from the air,
and scarcely completed an inch and half of lace
in a day.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Varnishes</strong> are made by dissolving <em>resins</em> or
gum-resins in alcohol, ether, &amp;c., so that as the
spirit evaporates the varnish dries down into a
transparent film; varnishes are coloured with
aloes, annotto, cochineal, dragon’s blood, gamboge,
indigo, red saunders, saffron, or turmeric.
<em>Amber varnish</em> is hardest and most durable in
colour, but dries very slowly. <em>Animé varnish</em>
dries quickly, but is liable to crack, and
deepens in colour with exposure to the air.
<em>Copal</em> ranks next to amber in durability,
and the varnish becomes lighter by exposure;
the best copal varnishes are slow in
drying unless mixed with animé. <em>Mastic</em> is a
favourite spirit varnish used as a picture varnish
and for delicate works of a pale colour. <em>Damar</em>
mixed with mastic makes an appropriate varnish
for maps and similar work. The qualities to be
sought in varnishes for a painting are that they
should resist damp, exclude air, and not injure
the colour. (See also <span class='sc'>Italian varnish</span>,

<p class='c007'><strong>Windows.</strong> The earliest of stained glass in
Italy were painted by order of Pope Leo III.,
at Rome, in 795. The windows of some churches
were closed with valves or shutters of stone,
like those of the Duomo of Torcello, erected in
1008. Others were filled with slabs of transparent
talc or alabaster. The earliest painted
glass in York Cathedral is of <span class='fss'>A. D.</span> 1200. The
use of glass windows in private houses was not
general until the 14th century. During the
Middle Ages glass windows were in movable
wooden frames, and were taken away by
families when they travelled. (Consult <em>Hallam’s
Middle Ages</em>, vol. iii.) Substitutes for glass were
thin parchment or linen, painted and varnished,
or even paper. (<em>Le Vieil</em>, <em>de la Peinture sur
Verre</em>.) These paper windows may still be
seen in villages in the north of Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Winds</strong> (Latin, <em>Venti</em>). The impersonations of
the <em>winds</em> were held in high veneration, especially
by the Athenians. The four principal
were Eurus or Vulturnus, the east or south-east
wind; Auster, the south wind, the Notus of the
Greeks, pernicious to plants and men; Zephyrus,
the son of Aurora and father of Carpus
(fruit), a genial, health-bearing breeze, called
also <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζωηφόρος</span>, life-bearing; and Boreas, the
strong north wind, usually represented with the
feet of a serpent, his wings dripping with golden
dewdrops, and the train of his garment sweeping
along the ground. Inferior <em>winds</em> were
Solanus, in Greek Apeliotes, answering to the
east, and represented as a young man holding
fruit in his lap; Africus, south-west, represented
with black wings and melancholy countenance;
Corus, north-west, drives clouds of
snow before him; Aquilo, north-east by north,
equally dreadful in appearance, from <em>aquila</em>, an
eagle, type of swiftness and impetuosity.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Windsor Chairs.</strong> A plain kind of strong
wooden chairs, so called.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Wings</strong>, from time immemorial, have been the
Oriental and Egyptian symbol of power as well
as of swiftness; of the spiritual and aerial, in
contradistinction to the human and the earthly;
also in Chaldaic and Babylonian remains, in the
Lycian and Nineveh marbles, and on the gems
and other relics of the Gnostics. In Etruscan
art all their divinities are winged.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Wings</strong>, in theatres. The shifting side-scenes

<p class='c007'><strong>Wood-carving.</strong> One of the most ancient
manifestations of the art instinct of humanity is
found in the very earliest relics of every nation.
Especially in Egypt specimens remarkable for
fidelity of representation have been recently disinterred,
and stand in the Boulac Museum.
Among Christian countries Germany is the
most distinguished in this branch of art, but
Holland and Belgium closely rival it in excellence
and abundance of early specimens. Illustrious
English carvers in wood were mostly of
Dutch or German extraction. The most famous
of them is Grinling Gibbons, employed by Sir
Christopher Wren in the decoration of St.
Paul’s Cathedral. He excelled in carving
flowers and foliage.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Wood-engraving</strong> or <strong>Xylography</strong>. Box-wood
is the only kind that can be used. The blocks
when smoothed and polished are prepared for
drawing on, by rubbing the polished surface
with <em>bath brick</em> in very fine powder mixed with
water. When this thin coating is dry, it is removed
by rubbing the block on the palm of the
hand; its only use is to make the surface less
slippery. There are four descriptions of cutting
tools used in wood-engraving. The <em>graver</em> is
not very different from that used for copper-plate,
but has the point ground to a peculiar
form by rubbing on a <em>Turkey stone</em>. Eight or
nine <em>gravers</em>, of different sizes, are generally required
commencing with a very fine one, which
is called the <em>outline tool</em>, and increasing in size
or breadth. <em>Tinting</em> is cutting series of parallel
lines, which, when engraved, form an even and
uniform tint. For this process there is a distinct
set of tools called <em>tinting tools</em>. <em>Gouges</em> of
different sizes are used for scooping out the wood
towards the centre of the block, and flat tools or
<em>chisels</em> for cutting it away towards the edges.
The earliest known wood-engraving, “The
Virgin surrounded by four Saints,” is dated
1418. A print of it is in the Brussels Museum.</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Wreath.</strong> Wreaths have at all times been

single city. These festivals were instituted by
Theseus, and held every year in the month of
July. Another name for them was <em>Metœciæ</em>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετοίκιαι</span>).</p>

<p class='c007'><strong>Xystus</strong>, Gr. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξυστός</span>). A covered place
situated near a portico, within which, in a
palæstra or stadium, athletes went through their
exercises. Pausanias tells us that this part of
the stadium received its name from the fact that
Hercules used every day to clear out the palæstra
at Elis in order to inure himself to toil, and that
he tore up many weeds by scraping (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξύω</span>, to
scrape, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξυστός</span>). The baths and thermæ at
Rome were furnished with large xysti, in which
young men went through a number of exercises.
The term <em>xystus</em> was also generally applied by
the Romans to the beds of rare flowers and
shrubs in the centre of the peristyle; it also denoted
a garden walk perfectly straight, and
planted in a regular style; and lastly, an open
walk or terrace in a garden attached to any
building.</p>

<p class='c006'>The letter <strong>Y</strong> is called the letter of Pythagoras
because that philosopher made it the symbol of
life. The foot of the letter, he said, represented
infancy, and as man gradually rises to the age of
reason, he finds two paths set before him, the
one leading to good, the other to evil, portrayed
by two forks of the letter. The illustration is
the device of Jean de Morvilliers (+ 1577),
Chancellor of France; the harrow tied to the
Pythagorean <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Υ</span>, a <em>rebus</em> on his name <em>Mort-vie-liers</em>—“Death
and life united.” The harrow
is the symbol of Death, which makes all things
equal. (Fig. <a href='#fig_701'>701</a>.)</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
